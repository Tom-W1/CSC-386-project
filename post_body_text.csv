0,"It’s a constant sense of wanting to go somewhere else. I’d feel better if i was at this place. Then you go there and then it’s the same exact feeling, just in a different physical location. 

I feel mentally homeless and I just want to go home.


Edit: I didn’t think this would get traction and that’s my first gold. Thanks buddy."
1,"I can't hide, I can't cry out loud, they don't understand me if I can't clean my room or can't go out. They watch me fall apart and criticise me while it happens."
2,"This is me. Don’t get me wrong, it’s better than don’t-leave-my-bed-for-a-week depression. I am grateful I can be an independent person. But there is something uniquely horrible about being able to go to work every day, occasionally clean up after yourself, pay your bills, generally put yourself together enough to look like a human being... but that’s it. Nothing else. No social life. No hobbies. Constantly battling your mind. And being absolutely fucking exhausted all the time."
3,"I woke up today wanting to die. I was planning on doing it after school so I decided school was pointless to go to. I walked to the mall by my school and went to a Kneader's and ordered french toast. French toast has always been my favorite so I figured it would be a good last thing to eat. I pondered a ton about my life and what it is I really want. I felt super empty but also my mind was racing with thoughts. I had convinced myself I needed to finish my life today. I had been thinking for about half an hour when an elderly man sat across from me and gave me a hot chocolate. He said that he ordered it for me because he could tell I needed it. He told me ""I don't know what you're going through, but life will get better."" And then he left. And then I cried. And now I'm back at school, and I think I want to live. 

Edit: Thank you to everyone who responded to this and messaged me and just were so kind. <3 "
4,"I wrote a suicide note earlier in the morning. I spent most of the day doing things that used to make me happy: getting coffee, walking in the park, listening to music, etc. I ate my “last meal” while listening to Bob Marley.

About an hour before I was going to kill myself, my friend from college messaged me and asked to play Xbox. We ended up reminiscing on good times, and laughing our asses off. It felt nice to feel like somebody cared about me. We’re planning on playing tomorrow too.

I don’t feel as bad as I did earlier today and I also am glad that I didn’t kill myself.

Edit: thank you for the gold, friend:)

Edit: thank you for the silver, friend:) I’m currently sitting at a coffee shop, reading all the kind messages everyone has sent. It means a lot to me"
5,"Recently I thought I was beginning to feel better. Not quite happy, but just sort of... I don’t know, content? But my depression always seems to come back, sometimes stronger than others. This has happened in the past too. I’m worried that one day the gust of depression will blow too strongly and the branch i’m hanging onto will snap. Or maybe not. That could just be the apathy speaking though. Anybody else really frustrated by this? It feels like i’m always walking a razors edge between being fine, and being depressed and one misstep causes me to lose my balance. Ugh. 

Edit: evidently, there are quite a few people who experience similar feelings. I just want to say that it makes me happy in a sad sort of way to know that we are all going through something similar in our lives. It makes things less lonely."
6,"You’re depressed!

You’re okay, it’ll take time, but you’re okay!

What the hell is taking so long, life blows, you’re depressed again!

You woke up and got dressed today, it’s looking up from here?

SIKE, you fucking idiot, did you truly believe your depression was done with you? You’re dumber than you lead yourself to believe!

Okay, we’re okay, we’re gonna make it. I just gotta stay strong.

Oop, you fucked up once today, I’m dragging your ass back into the dark. 

OVER AND OVER AND OVER! 

Is there really only one way out? I don’t know if I wanna die, I got a brother who may need me one day. I’m tired. So tired, man."
7,"But here I am, 24 years old man and doing exactly that."
8,"I look normal on the outside, but that's because I try very hard to."
9,"I hate being told: ""It'll get better when you're older."" No it fucking won't. I've waited for over a decade for things to get better & they haven't. It's especially not true when I see people younger than me living better, happier, & more interesting lives. Clearly that means I'm a failure & I just can't properly do this game we call life.

Just today someone I know who's younger than me just managed to find their own apartment with their SO. I can't do that now & if that doesn't scream that I'm a pathetic loser, I don't know what does."
10,Thank you all for the supportive messages. It’s heartwarming to know that I’m not alone. I know we can all get through this together. I love each and every single one of you 
11,"I don’t know if that makes sense. What I mean is that I stay up as late as possible wasting time because I know that if I go to sleep, I’ll wake up and have to go to school. I usually go to bed at around 3:30am and get up at 6am and it’s destroying me, I’ve been doing this for months and I’m physically weak and exhausted constantly because of it but my depression and anxiety demand it. And they always seem to get their way. 

Edit: I’m really glad that this spoke to so many people, it feels good knowing I’m not alone. Sending lots of love to you all. This isn’t easy but I believe in you ❤️"
12,"I read a lot of posts on here of people struggling with daily, debilitating depression that plagues every aspect of their lives, making it difficult to do small things like even take a shower. I feel that I am on the opposite side of the spectrum and wanted to share that it is equally as horrible.

From an outsider's perspective, I appear to be a very happy and stable individual. I have a financially secure job and I go to work every day and not only try my best but actively try to get along with others and make people laugh every day. My coworkers like me, and some look up to me. No one would think I have any problems at all. However, I feel like I am hidden behind a veil, and when I come home from work and when I am in the privacy of my home, I am in such crippling depression. I have such terrible episodes of sadness. I hate myself. I over-analyze everything stupid I do or say throughout the day and I replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself. I don't feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely don't know why anyone even likes me. And yet I still get up every day, live this routine, and put on a facade like I am okay. It feels like I am living a double life that I cannot escape."
13,"Does anyone else feel this way?  This has been crossing my mind a lot lately

EDIT: I just want to thank everyone for the thoughtful, kind comments I've been recieving.  It's been a nice change and I really appreciate it.  You guys are the best.  :)"
14,"Thank you, that really helps. Now I feel ten times worse."
15,"I feel decent. I'm watching YouTube or I'm just browsing the internet and all of a sudden my mind is like: ""Everything in life requires effort and I'm way too exhausted to try. I have a long life ahead of me but it's too much of a bother. I don't want to live.""

Even if I'm feeling optimistic about my future and, ""what if everything really does work out the way I want it to?"" I feel like it's way too tiring to live the life I want and all I want is to sleep and do nothing.

Everyone says life is short but to me it seems so long and burdening and I don't want to do it. I think if I knew that I would inevitably drop dead in 10 years then I would feel a bit more motivated, but just knowing that it's likely that I'll have to wait 50 more fucking years before I might finally drop dead is like a giant weight on my shoulders."
16,Just curious if anyone else affected by this problem also noticed quite a big cognitive decline. Or if anyone has noticed a cognitive decline and managed to build themselves back up to that previous cognitive level.
17,"I think I may have depression, but I find it so hard to talk about, because every time I try I feel like I am just making something out of nothing. I can write out 5 messages to a friend but never send them because everything I write feels like a lie.

I managed to initiate a conversation with a friend about it just now, then immediately had to back out of it because everything i wanted to say felt like I was simply seeking attention or somehow trying to trick them. They were so supportive but I shut it down. Now I feel even more like I am just being melodramatic or attention seeking."
18,"She was only 67. She told me every so often about how she always thought she'd end up with her ex husband again and how she thought they were meant to be together in the end, I don't know if she ever got the chance to tell him how she felt.

I'm extremely shaken up, but I think she wouldn't want me to be sad for her.

In her memory I'm going to tell the people I love how I feel, give my dog a hug, and remember that she is in my corner rooting for me when I feel like nobody else is.

Edit: thanks everyone for your kind words, I feel less alone about this now. In lieu of a funeral she wanted people to donate to her dog's vet clinic because she was a huge animal lover. Maybe toss a few donations toward your local clinic or shelter to help spread her love even further"
19,"i feel this way around everyone, friends, family, coworkers, anywhere i go. i just always feel like i’m in the background. but at the same time i like going unnoticed so i don’t have to talk to anyone and be in the spotlight.."
20,"I can’t even remember the last time i woke up excited for anything.

edit: Wanted to thank everyone for their kind words and sharing your own stories. Definitely glad to have this community it helps to know we aren’t alone even though it may feel that way."
21,"Happens to me a lot. Cooking, walking to class, brushing my teeth...sometimes I just stop for like a minute, feel a tremendous sense of self-hatred and suicidal ideation, and then continue on as if nothing ever happened."
22,"It feels like the harder I try to better myself, the harder it pushes back."
23,"Like, the old me wasn’t even that great either but damn "
24,I know that the fact that I can brush my teeth and shower each day and show up to work each day is a blessing with my depression. But I’m also sick of constantly feeling like I’m about to break. I hate nearly downing my pills each night only to wake up the next day to plaster a fake as smile on my face and go to work. Each night I think to myself I can’t go on like this and each day I do. Part of me just somehow wishes I completely gave up and just hit rock bottom. I don’t know. Anyone else feel the same?
25,"I was depressed, failing school, etc and I decided I should do my homework at a coffee shop one day. I went in and the owner was super nice and asked me if I wanted to join the rewards program and I was really craving community at this point and I was super excited. 
I kept coming back to the shop to do my homework and the owner and the baristas would always welcome me and they were always happy to see me. I started to get to know everybody there very well and now I consider them all friends. 
I found that when depressed having different communities helps a lot, and it turns out a lot of the other regulars at coffee shops also are depressed or have other mental illnesses. 
A two dollar drink can let you stay there for a few hours and by being nice to everyone around you and being somewhat productive on work it can be a really great place to have"
26,My life is objectively very easy but my depression makes it all feel like a struggle
27,"I finally did it guys!!!!! 2 years!! 

I was so depressed 2 years ago I started skipping classes, I failed every single class I was in. My GPA dropped to a 1.7. I lost my financial aid, which I couldn't go back the next semester without.

I spent the last 2 years, becoming more and more depressed because I couldn't afford to go back and I ruined my life over depression. 

But I finally did it!!!! (with the consistent encouragement of my boyfriend who told me hes going to keep on top of my ass and I'm not allowed to skip class) I still have a year and a half left for my associate's because of how much I failed but it's a start.

Edit: I cant believe how many people replied to this!! Thank you all so much for encouraging me, to know I had 100+ people comment to tell me how proud they are makes me even more motivated to do well this semester. 

Also to all the people who said this post gave them a little kick in the ass to go back, were all going to do amazing :)"
28,I'm so tired and I hate everything.
29,"I imagine these ridiculous scenarios in which I somehow get 'saved' from my depression by others. Like an intervention where someone comes and tries to save me.


 But now my mind is clear. No one is coming to save me. It is up to us.



But how can you mend yourself when all you want to do is destroy yourself?"
30,It feels like I'm on a rollercoaster with 80% super lows and 20% kinda highs..
31,"I'm so tired of making excuses. I am sick, just in my head."
32,"I MADE IT. FUCK EVERYONE WHO PUT ME DOWN. FUCK THE BULLIES, FUCK THE CLIQUES, I DID IT. But more importantly, THANK YOU to everyone who kept me going. It brings me to tears thinking about how thankful I am to be here today because of my family, friends, and the wonderful people on this subreddit who helped me when I was down. I feel so immensely proud and happy right now because of my achievements. To all the people struggling through high school and college, there is light at the end of the tunnel. I LOVE YOU ALL!!!!


Edit: wow thanks for all the awards, love, and support!"
33,It's the closest thing to dying. This life sucks.
34,I miss when I was happy and life wasn't pointless.
35,"My actual personality is over the top, fun(in my opinion), confident, and kind. But the depression teams up with social anxiety so that I just don't have enough enough energy to act like who I truly am. I turn into this very flat, monotone, boring, quiet person who I would never want to hang out with or date.

It's the main reason I avoid social interaction now - it feels humiliating because I feel like I'm perceived as this pathetic, pitiable, ignorable person.

 When I'm feeling better and have a little more energy I can act like myself but usually I'm just this shell. It's horrible, like watching the progression of ALS in a loved one; they just slowly fade away until there's nothing left of who they used to be. At least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself, that fundamental spark of who you truly are, and you're able to show that and share that with others. I don't even have that privilege. 

Sorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive, this is just how I feel.

edit: Guys, thanks so much for all the responses. I appreciate all of you. I didn't know so many people felt the same way, and I'm glad if I was able to help give voice to your struggles. I've had depression my whole life so I've had a lot of time to think about these things. I think it helps to be able to really narrow down what you're feeling. I wish you all luck in getting better."
36,"I'm discouraged today! :D 

Edit: This is a bit overwhelming. But reading all your comments was lovely. I hope every single one of you struggling will find the light one day. I guess we can run this marathon together if that's what it should come for. You lean on me so your broken leg doesn't hurt as much, and I'll lean on the second person, etc. Have a wonderful day ❤️"
37,"But depression is much more than that. 

It’s the excuses you have to make when you can’t make that meeting. 

It’s the friends and family you’ve lost because you can’t explain why. 

It’s the opportunities that land in everyone else’s lap, that they get to grasp with both hands, while yours slip out of your grasp. 

It’s the exhaustion that binds your body to your bed. 

It’s the hatred and resentment you feel towards yourself, towards the world for being the way it is. 

It’s your proven truth that everything and everyone gets better, except for you. 

It’s the demon that dragged you down and trapped you in the hellish prison that is your own mind. 

It’s the ball and chain locked around your neck, choking the life out of you as you trudge through your marathon, while everyone else gets to charge on ahead, unimpeded. 

It’s the wall that blocked you off from life. 

It's the leech that sucked out everything positive about your life and clouds your memories. 

It’s not just being “sad”. And we can only wish it was. 

*Edited to add: Thank you all for the kind words and awards. I really didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did. I wrote this in an attempt to put my experience with depression into words, and to serve as a reminder of what it feels like, for the times when normal people try to tell me my depression isn't real or otherwise downplay it.*"
38,I hate this.
39,"Saying things like “she’s so emotional hahaha” and telling her friend everything I just said that was making me upset.

Everything about me is just a joke to her, just a topic of discussion for her to gawk over.

I don’t even know why I’m crying, what else should I expect from someone who hasn’t ever given me any kind of legitimate emotion support."
40,"I have one friend I text regularly. Everyone else I either think they don't like me or I don't like them.

As an introvert by nature this is so dangerous as I end up in a lonely depression spiral since my tendency is to want alone time, but not alone time all the time.

EDIT: well with this many upvotes, I guess I don't feel as alone. Hope everyone is doing ok tonight."
41,"“Your face lights up, your smile is infectious, but your eyes always look like you’re staring at a freight train while you’re standing on the tracks in front of it.”

Man if that didn’t fuck my shit up for the rest of the day"
42,"I don’t think i could ever kill myself but that doesn’t mean I don’t want to die. It’d just be so much easier than disappointing everyone I love if something just happened to me and I died. I know it isn’t right to think like this but I can’t stop.


Edit: this blew up, it’s kinda bittersweet knowing so many others feel the same.

Edit 2: thank you all so much for the words of encouragement. I’m home now and would love to reply to all of them but I have to do homework. Things will get better for all of us if there’s this much support in the world."
43,"I found that a lot of times in the past I would be rushed out the office with crappy advice that I was already “trying” to do and then I panic and try to desperately get everything out by the end of the session. It’s hard to open up about it when I’m having an episode because the symptoms of pure confusion, difficulty thinking and focusing, MEMORY LOSS and just plain blankness of mind makes everything so frustrating... 



*For not from depression, sorry"
44,"I wrote a suicide note today. 

I listened to funeral music.

I lined up all my pills.

I cried. And cried more.

I thought of my mom.

I thought of my dad.

I thought of Ang.

I thought of Paulie.

I thought of Kris.

I thought of everyone.

I thought of soldiers in war.

I thought of terminal illness.

I thought of my possible future..

I remembered what I'd be losing.

I felt a rage grow in me.

I put away my pills.

I listened to angry music.

I didn't kill myself today.

EDIT: Wow! This is an amazing community. I never expected so many people to see this, let alone take the time to send kind words. Thank you everyone. Waking up to this made my day. And I'm proud of you all too, for surviving another day in this mixed up, crazy world. Today's been better so far. It took a lot to drag myself out of bed, but right now baby steps are good. All your encouragement means more to me than I can express in words. I love you all!"
45,"I just broke down. That just overwhelming feeling of worthlessness and self hate just maxed out. I sat in my dark living room sobbing and trying to decide if I should write anything. Before I could do anything my cat came and jumped on me. He pressed his face to mine and I just snapped back. I’m trying so hard to get better. I’m glad my cat jumped on me. That sweet little guy saved me.

Edit: I want to thank everyone for their kind words. I didn’t expect to receive so much kindness. For those wondering, I am currently seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for mental health and medication management.

To the few people who said hurtful things. My story may be “cliche and boring” but it’s still my fucking life. It’s my experience, I can’t change it to make it more exciting or interesting for you. It wouldn’t be real then. To those who told me to try again and that I’m a failure. You don’t have to tell me that. I know but I’ve never been more happy to fail at something in my life."
46,"Just a loop of unhappiness, really hope I can fix it soon.  I wanna know what the fuck happened to my motivation and care for life."
47,Today I was feeling extremely low. I don't know but my I feel like my ability to process information and write has been decreased. I'm just so angry and irritable. I hate this feeling
48,
49,what do you guys say when someone gets mad at you for being sad? or when your being moody because your sad?
50,Do you guys see what I’m saying here. I’m always constantly completely bullshitting myself 24/7. I always pretend that there are a few certain things that would make me feel a little better then I get them and I want the opposite. Complete self destruction and all 
51,I lowkey wish I can be pushed over the edge so I'll have the courage to end it all (as horrible as that sounds)
52,"As the title says. I feel like I'm getting worse and worse at everything. I feel like I'm getting weaker, much much dumber (I used to know a shit ton of trivia, a lot of history and be really good at helping people out. Now I've forgotten most things unless I read up on it daily, I've been relying more and more on canned responses when talking to people and I've become completely socially unaware). Things that used to be easy are now difficult, I constantly make typos and I can't even concentrate on things I like, much less things I dislike.

Anyone else feel like that?"
53,
54,"This has been really scaring me lately. Since becoming depressed I've noticed more and more;

- an inability to maintain thoughtful conversations with people

- severely reduced attention span

- short term memory loss

- severely reduced motivation

I think it largely has to do with my partaking in escapism, as I spend much more time browsing reddit/youtube and getting high since when I actually try to focus on work I usually end up crying. The result seems to be a feeling like I've been living in a haze, like I'm never really fully aware of what's going on, I'm just passively going through the motions of life. 

Getting out of this rut is going to be so much harder than I thought. I literally feel stupider now that I've been depressed for months. I can barely even talk to people in my classes now, they seem so competent and on top of things while I'm just an embarrassment who can barely form a coherent sentence."
55,It makes me feel less alone and its like im safe from everything in there and a sense of dread takes over me when im finished and i have to get out and face the world again Weird post lol sorry
56,"After bordering on suicidal yesterday, I was surprised to find I had the motivation to get out of bed when I woke up this morning. The first thing I did was make my bed, and that’s a victory in my book. 

I love you all.

Edit: Thank you for the Silver, and for the heartwarming comments. It means a lot!

Edit 2: This has me all kinds of emotional. I’ve never had so much faith in the kindness of strangers."
57,"WELL I SURE SHOWED THEM, DIDN'T I?

I'm a massive fuckup. I forget things the minute after I am told them. There's just a massive pile of fuzzy static in my head. My grammar has devolved into caveman-speak.

I dunno if I blame my mental health or if I'm just stupid."
58,"It’s so stressful. There’s so many things I want to do but I just can’t at the moment and it sucks. Theoretically, I could be physically paralyzed for months and it would be just the same as if I wasn’t paralyzed and living my regular depressed life. Watching your life go by without any motives and meaning as you have no one there beside you because you’ve kicked everyone out of your life is one of the worst feelings for me."
59,I’ve felt empty for days and just now cried a little. Even though I’m miserable I was almost happy. It’s worse to feel like you’re dead than being sad.
60,"Too much of a coward to kill myself, but at the same time have no reason to live. I just need to know that I’m not alone who feels like this in this hour."
61,"I just go through the routine every day, and kinda let everything just pass by. I don't really have much of an emotional response to anything, and my personality feels like a mush of stuff. Like, whenever things go wrong, people say they want to die, and while, yeah, I don't like what happened, I just feel kinda... neutral."
62,"My depression has been doing so good, I’m so proud. But my mom passed away last night of pulmonary veno occlusive disease. Really needing positivity in these trying times. Thank you so much <3"
63,i wish i could still be motivated throughout the day. 
64,"I don't know if I'm depressed or if I've just lost my personality and identity. I don't know if this is me now or what? 
I'm nothing like the old me and it kills me to admit it. 7 years back dad said it was just a stage I'm going through, yet here I am. All my friends are still themselves I'm completely fucking different"
65,"This has probably happened hundreds of times in my lifetime. I'm 50 now, so obviously I haven't succumbed to depression yet. But the peaks and valleys are insane; I guess *I'm* insane. Yesterday it fully made sense to me - if I had had immediate means to end my life I could see taking that action. This is why I can never have a gun, or live in a tall building.  
So far that small voice in me that says ""It will get better, just wait"" has remained more powerful than the other larger, louder voice that says ""You've always been alone. You'll always be alone. Life isn't worth the pain."" My reality is having both of those voices in my brain, and feeling that both are absolutely real when they're there."
66,"My depression has depression bro. A lot of the time I doubt that I have a mental illness, and blame myself for being incapable of doing normal things. I feel empty all the time, yeah, I have a diagnosis, yeah, but I still manage to doubt myself anyways. It almost feels like it’s normal to feel empty. It’s strange when people tell me they can do their school work, have a job, and feel happy by second nature. It seems like feeling this way is normal, but I also feel like I’m alone in this? It’s weird. I tell myself things like, “this isn’t because of the depression, it’s because you’re worthless and incapable of doing anything.” I tell myself that this is an excuse to sit in bed and do nothing. But deep down I would give anything in the world to feel happiness. 
I hope this isn’t just me. Like deadass, I don’t know if I’m the only person who feels like this. And if I am that’s just gonna scare me."
67,"I’ve felt better these past few months. A lot better, great even. But this Christmas it’s like... I can’t bring myself to care for the Holidays - and it’s my favourite Holiday. I can’t explain it. 

My family lives two hours away and I almost didn’t go, just because I wanted to be alone in my apartment, doing absolutely nothing. But I’m a single child, my parents are single children, all my grandparents are dead - it’s just us three. They’re getting old, too. I couldn’t just *not* go. They would have been so sad and I don’t want that.

But I’m just empty and miserable and it’s Christmas so I have to put up a front, a nice dress and be nice.

Gosh this is hard.

Merry Christmas.

Edit: wow, you guys know how to make someone feel special and a little less alone. Thank you, kind strangers! ❤️"
68,"I'm so fucking done with this shit. I've had multiple exams this week all during my colleges green beer day fesitivies, which I've had to skip due to studying. Then I get asked why I'm not at our parties, and my friends asking why I haven't been going to the gym with them. Then my parents asking why I'm spending money at Chipotle and Wendy's and shit like I'm supposed to be eating green ass shit from whole foods all day. Then I'm supposed to also be spending time playing sports and video games and reading bc apparently that's the shit I like to do. Fuck this. How is anyone supposed to do this? What the fuck is the point. Sorry for ranting. Fuck this week. Been shit. Anyone want to talk? I need a study break I wanna help some people, maybe do some good in this fucked world. Love all of you "
69,"This world and all the people living in it is such a heaping pile of horseshit. Nobody has a fuck to give about mental illness. It's blatantly obvious. Fuck this.

Edit: This post isn't about me, it's about other people."
70,"But I do. Every time. Because saying ""I threw up everywhere last night"" gets you a ""Oh sweetie, take the day off to rest, it's okay!"", but saying ""My depression is acting up really badly and I just can't do it today"" gets you a ""Don't be lazy! Everyone gets sad, suck it up and come into work!"".

I shouldn't have to be fucking ashamed of my depression. It's as medical as the flu, yet people seem to think mental illnesses aren't a valid reason, and that you're not really sick.

Fuck that shit. We need to break the stigma towards mental illnesses in general."
71,Whenever I feel sad I don’t try to cheer up I try to make myself sadder because I like it more. I feel addicted to isolating myself from others and there’s a small part of me that enjoys feeling depressed and isolated. Depression feels strangely comforting at times. Does anyone else have this issue?
72,"I had a long, very long suicide not stored in my phone, just waiting, and yesterday I deleted  it, i know it it’s not a huge step, but I feel ultimately better!

Update- I didn’t expect this to blow up, I posted it because I couldn’t believe I had finally done it; and I had felt so good, I’m trying to say thank you to everyone who commented, thank you to whoever gave me gold, you’re the best, and you all are amazing. Thank you!

Update 2- to everyone saying I inspired them to delete theirs, I cannot comprehend how good that made me feel that I helped to inspire you guys, I am so proud of every one of you. Thank you for all the love and support. I’m blown away and feel incredibly uplifted right now."
73,"Dreaming is also a bonus. Sure the occasional nightmares are bad, but at least it's better than being awake, where you feel bad 100% of the time."
74,"I literally don’t want to do anything at all. It doesn’t bring me any happiness or joy or whatever. At best, just distracts me from feeling shitty. Absolutely nothing helps. Video games, writing, reading, doing photography, drawing... none of that makes me happy.

It’s the absolute fucking WORST. I don’t even feel like sleeping, but I don’t wanna be awake either. I go to bed before 7pm because I have nothing else I wanna do. All I do is lie in bed and listen to miserable songs and cry, then I go to sleep, wake up and repeat.

I hate living. I hate this existence. I wish I could just die in my sleep.

EDIT: This got a lot more attention than I thought so I just wanna day that I’m reading all your comments and I love you all"
75,I spend so much time thinking about how I wish my life was that I can’t face the actuality of where I am.
76,"So this happened about 5 months ago but I found out about it this morning right after she broke up with me. We had been dating just about a year and I genuinely loved her with all my heart. I trusted her so much and she knew I have severe depression. I cant understand how another human can be that shitty. Anyone willing to talk?


EDIT: just found out she cheated on me with another guy too. She's completely blaming it on me despite me treating her nothing but great while we dated. Back to feeling terrible again, just after the responses to this post made me actually feel pretty good :')"
77,"""Bottling emotions is extremely unhealthy. You know, you can talk to me about anything.""

*dumps brain onto poor unsuspecting soul*

""Wow, you should talk to a therapist about that. I believe in you though!""

Edit: Thanks for all the supportive comments. To those suggesting I not open up to people who don't get it, I completely agree. This has happened to me when opening up to people who used to be very close friends who don't really have the time for me anymore. I'm not just dumping my brain on anyone who asks."
78,"I read this a lot here, ""I don't want to kill myself, I just wish I didn't exist"". I identify with that...  so much. I just don't want to keep feeling like this anymore, and for whatever reason that thought is amplified as I'm trying to sleep (e.g. right now). All I want is to simply not wake up tomorrow. Is that so much to ask for?

Edit: wow, I did not expect to get so many responses when I wrote this yesterday. Although sad, it's still oddly comforting to know I'm not alone in feeling this way, so thank you sincerely for sharing. For those who offered helpful tidbits, thank you also. I hope that you all find peace one way or another, just as I hope that I can too. But let's face it, chances are that's won't be tonight, so.... here we go again."
79,I always feel angry or annoyed or nothing is going right and I've felt like this around the same time as my depression reared its ugly head. So many things piss me off. I sometimes even go into borderline misanthropy because of my depression induced anger. It's led me to have fights with people who are my family and friends and I don't know why I push them away
80,"A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. 

I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any ""normal"" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. 

Here's the breakdown:  with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me ""not having enough social activity"", as ""not having enough will"", and have called my therapy ""a waste of time."" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition. 

Any and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you."
81,"I sleep so much. I enjoy it because it’s an escape without death. I don’t want to die but I don’t enjoy living, so I sleep. It’s a way of “living” without actually having to live. Sigh. If I could stay in bed all day and sleep, I would."
82,"I swear to God, if I manage to kill myself and someone say some bullshit like ""If only she talked to us we'd have helped"" I'm coming back as a ghost to make their life a living hell.

Keep your problem to yourself and your therapist because everyone else WILL use them to hurt you."
83,"I contemplated suicide a few years ago. Couldn't take it anymore, everything was going to shit (you could argue it still is), obstructive suicidal thoughts,etc. So one day I decided to kill myself by hanging. Pretty straight forward right? Well the thing is i live in a bad neighborhood and there aren't a lot of hanging -friendly trees. They were only on main streets and i can't hang myself in front of the free clinic. I'd make them feel bad. And someone would take my shit, cant have that. Very surreal and fustrating using Google Maps to find a half decent suicide spot especially when you're working with shitty MetroPCS service.

Finally i found a spot. Small walking bridge in a secluded section of a neighborhood park. Good. Now for the suicide note. I get to work, banging it out all through the night. ""Not meant for this world"" ""i know you'll miss me but it's for the best."" Hit all the basic bullet points. Done. Now..........make a noose. But idk how to make a noose........so i look it up on WikiHow. 20 studious minutes later i have a functioning noose. All of a sudden i feel something from deep inside my deadened, numb brain. I'm proud of myself?? I'm proud if myself!!! I try to switch back to suicide mode but my mind is wandering now. ""I made a noose, thats kind of dope."" ""What else can i make?"" ""Homemade ice cream? Hmm."" So at around 4:30 am on a weekday, possibly a tuesday, i made homemade ice cream and here i am now typing this from a crappy android phone.

P.S. the ice cream was terrible
"
84,"I've developed a habit of saying depressive thoughts out loud bc I'm always alone, always thinking them, and talk to myself when no one's looking. 

It's reached the point where instead of saying ""fuck"" when something goes wrong I'll say ""I want to kill myself"". It's become so engrained in my mind that I've come close to accidentally saying these when other people are around. 

Anyone else do this?"
85,"So most of you probably didn’t even see my post before, which is fine, obviously, but I just felt the need to put this update out for the ones who did. 3 days ago I was so close to taking my own life. I was going to jump off a bridge and end it all. I was drunk so it made matters only worse. As I sat there and thought to myself, a voice came in my head. This voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do, that I have so much more going for me, and I can’t lose my life over some girl. 

So here I am, 3 days later. The girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. We are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy. My happiness can’t be dependent on another person. That is unhealthy. I’ve started seeing a counselor and just doing more & staying active. I know In the end I can conquer these demons.

I would just like to say thank you to all of you who reached out to me that night. I obviously didn’t respond, but knowing that a random stranger online cares enough about another stranger to make sure they’re okay, well that is special to me. Thank you once again, and I hope every one in this sub finds some sort of happiness in their life. We all deserve it. This is a disease just like diabetes, and you should not be ashamed of it. Instead face it head on, and say “fuck you depression, I’m better than you.”"
86,"I usually decline social events when I'm really depressed because who would want to be around a depressed person, right?

So, I'll stay home by myself, which makes me feel even more isolated and down. But it's not that I don't want to be around people. I just don't want to pretend all night that I'm this other person -- I do that all day at work; it's exhausting. 

But to have a good friend come over and just be there, just sit with you while you watch Tv, it just makes me feel loved, which helps chip away at the sadness just a little bit."
87,"I get panic attacks over simple things this shit sucks bro
edit: listened to alexandrov ensemble and lots of blade runner and it’s helped clear my head. music really helps homies"
88,"This quote helps me to explain how I feel, when people ask questions about depression"
89,"I am one of probably millions of people who where told as kids how intelligent they were, but I don't see it in myself and I can't live up to those expectations put upon me. In middle school I got lazy and relied on my ""intelligence"" too much. Now I i feel like everyone has surpassed me just because my naive 10 year old self thought that I was somehow special or above average. Now in almost everything I score below average and can't keep up with others. Its been like this for all of the latter part of middle school and my high school years. now as everyone else is just about to graduate, its not even clear if I even will graduate. Everyone has clear goals and ambitions where as I don't see any real future for myself."
90,"Like, your presence is not important, everything would be the same even without you."
91,"Like I'll be out trying to enjoy myself and I'll be having a laugh or having a bit of fun but I still feel sad underneath, hard to explain but nothing feels fulfilling. Even hobbies I have just seem dull and I'm usually just trying to mask the pain so I don't have to feel. 

I hate this."
92,"Sometimes it just really hits me that maybe not today or tomorrow but eventually I will commit suicide. This realization really fucks me up. I wish this wasn’t the case. I wish so much I could be normal and happy but it’s been years and I’ve begun to really accept that my suicide is inevitable. I hope I’m proven wrong.

Edit: it’s been 160 days since I posted this and although not much has changed in my mindset I still come back often and read all the new comments. Those of you who commented or will comment I see you and just wanted to say thank you we’re not alone and although things suck they suck a bit less together."
93,"Like, not a full blown panic attack, but just the constant uncomfortable feeling of something not being right?"
94,This has happened to me twice this week. I think I’m dying.

96,Fuck New Years by the way
97,"A few weeks ago my depression got the best of me and I went off the deep end and quit my job.  I had $200 to my name and half a tank of gas. So I drove west. As far west as Laguna beach. I had never seen the ocean before. I spent $50 bucks on a hotel room outside of town. I put my toes in the sand and surf. The experience was something I will never forget. Also, the ocean is way bigger than I thought it would be no matter how dumb that sounds. It gave me the will power to keep going for some dumb reason. 

Not sure why I am sharing this other than to say that you never know what type of experience will bring you back, so to speak.

I’m back home with an interview next week.

Sometimes things aren’t as black as they are grey.

Edit: I got the job. For anyone who cares. Good times."
98,"I want to die so badly, but I cant do this to them. They greeted me with smiles and joy. My mother asking if I ate anything and if I wanted breakfast. My elderly father gave me a beautiful smile and asked how I slept. I dont want to make them suffer. If it weren't for them I would've killed myself already. They are also sick and need my help. I cant a abondon them. I'm so sick of living, but I have to live for them. I just want the suffering to end, and dying is the only way."
99,"How can someone love a mess like me? How can someone love me with all this fog in my brain, with these glaring imperfections, with a dark cloud above her head?"
100,"it's stupid, but i always doubt the fact i have depression, even after getting an official diagnosis, i'm still scared that i'm just an attention whore taking up everyone's time. Most of the time when i go to post something on here, i end up deleting it because i don't want someone in the comments to say something like ""your not actually depressed, your just a whiny teen"". I don't know. 

EDIT: Hey so i'm not the only one who feels this way. If anything it's slightly comforting to know that

EDIT 2: Yes i'm aware of the spelling mistake in the title, it's kinda hard to spell correctly when you're rambling at 11 pm"
101,"I never understood why so many people see depression as something we can all joke about so fucking carelessly and casually. Like, it's funny and relatable to see tweets and memes about how much depression sucks but it really does so much harm than good, doesn't it? I can't understand how this is just so commonplace. 

I laugh at them. Theyre funny. I see myself in them. And then for hours and days upon days I lock myself in my car with a vague numbness, ditching class or calling off work to just... what, stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot, chew through a pack of cigarettes, and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions. I stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of who's looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn. 

I don't sleep for days on end until I collapse. I lose weight in 7 pound intervals. The thoughts of being a fuck-up and how bad I would beat the shit out of myself if I met myself on the street just stew any time Im beside myself. It's so funny! So quirky and relatable! If this is relatable that's fucking tragic. Being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something I want everyone to laugh at with me. 

It's three am here and I'm just having a cigarette in an empty bathroom tub because I don't wanna think about anything. I wish there was a way to turn brains off. Medications haven't worked and I don't like being medicated at all anyway. It feels like hitting a plaster wall anytime I try to feel anything. Sure is loads of fun."
102,"As much as I wish people the best, I have to fight feelings of bitterness and jealousy all the damn time. I wanna know how to better cope with these feelings."
103,This happens to me a few times a year. It's like my brain is teasing me.
104,"its like when you are playing videogame and you get stuck on some part of mission,while others are having fun,you are having the worst time in ur entire life"
105,"Had one of those today. It feels like, for just a moment, I understand that I am indeed suffering from an illness. It's such a strange contrast from constantly thinking ""You're not actually sick, you're just a terrible person.""

Anyone else experience something similar?"
106,wait suicide just passes the pain to next person
107,I'm so fucking tired of feeling like i can't ever catch up. To anyone or anything. I can't keep up with life I'm so fucking tired of it. Why do I always feel like being alive is an uphill battle. I feel like i was damned upon conception. I was fucked from the start. With my fucked up head and my fucked up emotions I was FUCKED FROM THE START. I never stood a chance here. Why the living fuck do I always feel like I'm a thousand steps behind everyone else. Sometimes I want to end my life so badly but I am too afraid to hurt my family. I keep holding out for some god damn hope but every single fucking time it is proven that I am hopeless. I don't even know why I am on here I do not ever talk about my emotions nor do I ever post on reddit but i'm just so tired I don't know where else to put it... I don't think that I will ever be happy. I don't think I will ever live my life to the fullest. I don't think I'm going to ever change the world or be remembered. I don't think that I will ever amount to anything extraordinary. I don't think I will fulfill the wishes of God or whatever the fuck put me on this earth. I don't think that I will ever love myself. I don't know where else to go.... so I don't go anywhere. I remain here in this stagnant cycle.
108,"I want to die and leave this black hole of self hate and overwhelming sadness. I have a wonderful husband and two amazing teenage boys, and yet I find no joy in life. 
I don't want to commit suicide and scar my family that way. I just hope every day that I'll have a fatal heart attack, stroke, or get hit head on by a semi."
109,"I have been through a roller coaster of absolute pain and there is no light at the end of the tunnel that isn't just more of this roller coaster ride. The people close to me no longer show concern because that's just who I am to people now. They either don't know me, or they know how much I'd love to not exist but am still not strong enough to put an end to it. And that's the thing isn't it?  
  
**Nobody cares until you're gone.** Nobody cares until you can 'prove it'. We're 'attention seekers', except I've isolated myself from everyone and I don't communicate how I feel anymore to anyone but internet strangers who also don't know me and therefore don't care.   
  
Unless you're actually about to pull the trigger, people would prefer if you shut up, fucked off, stop bringing down the mood, stop being a burden, you're simultaneously too much and yet not enough.     
  
They don't care what's causing my misery. God forbid I mention a person, or people are the stressors to what I'm feeling. That is manipulation. Suicidal people are manipulative. We just latch on to people and bring them down.  
  
I'm sorry. I don't want to be this way. I have asked, pleaded, begged for help. Nobody has offered anything to actually help me. Throwing vague suggestions and hotlines and websites isn't help. Leaving me to figure out my own shit does not help.   
  
At the very least I have learned how to bottle most things up. Nobody will have to worry about hearing about my pain. And eventually, hopefully soon, nobody will have to worry about me at all.
  

  Edit: I think a lot of people misunderstood. Nobody in my inner circle is foreign to mental health struggles. My mother is half the reason I have them, biologically speaking. We have similar symptoms. I've made it clear what kind of help I need and what I need help with to get there. I'm shrugged off because my struggling with suicidal ideation is not as pressing of a matter as whatever else is going on.  This was also general observation of how people react to suicidal people."

Yesterday I decided to be happy.  

Thinking about you all.

112,I told my wife yesterday that I have suicidal thoughts sometimes and what I'm doing about it to feel better. Needless to say she went over the top about all the reasons I shouldn't and then went and told my mom without my permission. Guess I'm not telling her anything anymore. I'm in this shit alone.
113,"J remember i used to be funny. I used to laugh and make jokes. I remember being able to hold a conversation with people. I wanted to know people and give back. I was shy but querky,  talkative and funny around people who knew me.

I feel numb and unsatisfied with everything I do.

EDIT: wow thank you everyone for your responses. I thought this post would go unanswered honestly but its so comforting and reassuring to know that I'm not alone. We just have to find the strength from somewhere to keep going on. 


On a side note..

I'm not sure if anyone else feels like this but.. I sometimes think part of the reason is I have this intense fear of losing people. So much in fact that i start believing In  the values and hobbies of the people in my life in the hopes they'll like me  and not leave. I just agree and comply with everything. I've done this for so long I just don't know who I am anymore."

115,"Whenever someone posts something wholesome, everyone cheers for them. Nobody is envious or salty of seeing others get better.  
&nbsp;

Whenever someone posts something depressing, everyone comforts them. Nobody one-ups one another. This sub's etiquette is the epitome of ""Always be nice to people, but if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything at all.""  
&nbsp;

On other subs like AskReddit, whenever I post a question, it'll always get downvoted right away. I seriously don't care about karma, I just wish my questions become visible because I'm genuinely curious. My questions are usually something like, ""People who manage to get their life together, how did you do it?"".  
&nbsp;

I ask those questions because I'm looking for hope. I try not to make them sound negative but they'll always get downvoted. That makes me feel like I'm not allowed to hear something wholesome. It's like I'm being denied hope.

On this sub, it is normal for a post to have 2K upvotes, and stays 99% upvoted, if not 100%. Posts that don't take of, and only have 1 default upvote will usually stay 100% upvoted. So that means the people here very rarely downvote anything. If they're not upvoting it, they just leave it be. We use the upvote and downvote for what they're meant to.

119,"I’m getting really sick of anti-suicide types saying “hold on it gets better”. Yes it does for brief moments, but happiness wears off eventually and you’re sent plummeting down. But we all have to pretend that just because we’re going to therapy, or are getting medicated, or have been through suicide watch our lives have improved substantially. That’s not how depression works. 
Saying that things “get better” is worthless. If suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, then “things getting better” is a temporary solution to a permanent problem. People need to stop pretending there’s a cure for depression. It’s impossible. Because I was born with depression, I’m essentially a human mulligan."

I could be slow at work and my coworkers wouldn't think I'm lazy. They'd understand the physical toll cancer inflicts. 

People would rally around me. I could post about my journey on Facebook without shame. 

When I fall apart over small things people like to one up mentor tell me I dont have it bad at all. My health problems would be validated. 

Most importantly I wouldn't feel this terrible soul crushing desire to die.

126,"The title and this story may sound fake (New account to hopefully protect my identity), but I swear to you it could not be more real for me. I wanted to share this, I am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. More questions will be asked at the end of my story.  As the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. The paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast I was going, and I replied ""200 km/h"".

I have been depressed for 4 years now. Nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. I have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and even went a course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). First my motivation to do anything went down; I couldn't eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. My social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, I figured life wasn't going to get any better and I decided to end my life.

I drove to the mountains where I decided I would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. About 3 hours from my hometown I found the perfect hill, The road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. Without thinking too much (I would just talk myself out and not commit), I pulled a U-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. They say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. The most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. They suddenly disappeared as I approached my chosen hill. My foot automatically floored the gas pedal, I placed my left foot behind the brake so I wouldn't back out. I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was ""wow, I so much of a failure I can't even kill myself"". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won't get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!).

The everyone's surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said: ""It's a miracle you're alive"". I'm not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I'm alive, and I""m not going to waste it. I'm begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don't know how. I have tried CBT, I'm going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I'm on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources).

If anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. I'm still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and I believe it's a sign that I need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. I am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. I can personally say even those who are suiciding don't want to die, they merely just want to stop existing.

Please help with any advice you have, I'm begging for my life to change, please. I am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so I can give life another try.

Here are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot:

\-How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time?

\-How can I keep up or have more energy?

\-I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?)

\-What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression

\-Any secret self-help/feel good tips?

\-How do I make more friends and build a better support network?

\-What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just ""disappeared"" for a few days?

&#x200B;

Thanks to those who took the time to read this post, I usually get little to no reads on Reddit but I thought I'd share this anyway since not many people can say they survived a 200 km/h automobile suicide attempt and walked out with minor injuries. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

Edit: more questions

Edit 2: Thank you, everyone, for taking the time to write to me. I truly didn't believe this would reach this many people. I will try and reply/read everyones post but I am still in the process of seeing a lot of specialists. But I am truly grateful for all the love and support that has been sent my way. Thank you, I will make you all proud and try my best to implement all of the tips into my life."
127,"I’ve always been that kid that used to catch things fast,the one who’s been called smart compared to others at my age ,but now i just feel like i can’t really learn anything new,half of the time i just find myself hearing shit that goes through one ear and goes by the other,can’t remember shit that i just saw it 5m ago,sometimes i need to reed the same topic over and over again just bc i can’t focking process it right, fuck that

Edit:grammar

Edit 2: Thanks for all the replies guys i never  thought i would get so many replies for so many things i’ve been asking myself and i also learned  names of sensations i experienced that i didn’t know how to describe,  anyways thanks for all the support and help making me feel less lonely in this crazy world :)"
128,"Nothing ok, I lay in my bed depressed and slept till 6pm alright? Sorry I can't be normal and productive like you up at 9am with 50 friends. I'm a creature of darkness and death, you wouldn't understand my life you grew up with a happy loving middle class family. My entire life has been suffering and hate everything. I'm so tired of pretending I have a job and pretending to be normal. I'm exhausted."
129,"instead of called in from work or breaking down during my shift i cry on the drive to work.
instead of ranting on instagram or ranting on facebook i cry myself to sleep.
instead of telling people how i feel, i say im fine and smile knowing no one could understand how fucked iam.
instead of threating to kill myself, ive come to terms with the fact that i'll be gone soon once i get to my breaking point and end it all."
130,"It does not even have to be a major incident, but that tenuous grasp you had on climbing out of the hole, that little bit of hope that things are starting to turn around, suddenly releases and you are plummet back into the pit; and now you are too damn tired to try climbing out again ..."
131,I feel so empty. to the point that things i used to laugh at i no longer find amusing. Call me a coward but ive never told anyone about the way i feel maybe in order to be able to carry on with life with no more complications. I just want  someone to hold me close and tell me its going to be ok. I guess this is my cry for help.
132,It hurts realizing that your not this deep down to earth interesting smart person. Realizing you just a piece of trash that is useless. It doesnt matter wether im here or not. It just breaks my heart to realize that.
133,"This quote by Robin Williams has destroyed me. I’ve realized why I hate being with people more than being alone, even if I’m smiling and having fun. 

*EDIT* wow, thanks so much to every single supportive comment. means more than the world to feel supported. to everyone suggesting social media is a cause of this- is not the case here. i don’t use social media, because I know the conversations on there don’t follow me to my grave ❤️ real life human connection does. today was a good day, thankyou everyone for your love."
134,
135,"I have failed in nearly everything I had set out to do. I have no confidence to do anything else. 

I have no proper education, no friends, no job, no travel experience, no positive memories, no good relationships with anyone, no confidence, no productive hobbies, no self worth, and no future.

I'm worthless trash at the peak of my youth. The people I grew up with are pursuing their dream careers and traveling the world, enjoying their lives. I am sat here taking care of my needy family, looking for pathetic jobs, and engaging in escapism to forget that I am who I am.

I am 25 years old this year, a stupid idiot, a weak coward, a life loser, and a complete waste of space"
136,"There is always another day. And another. It never stops, no rest."
137,Especially when I think about all the terrible and cringey things I have done. Theres no getting around I'm a piece of shit so I feel better by accepting it.
138,Today I noticed a girl at my school had a semicolon tattoo (;) and I showed her mine. We really clicked and exchanged phone numbers. I think I made a new friend😊
139,Sometimes I forget it’s even a possibility
140,The worst part is now I have a girlfriend that I’ve dating for a while and I’m crazy about her and we’ve talked about our future together numerous times and she’s the single that can prevent me from reaching that true point of fully distanced from those I care about and it somehow makes me sad instead of happy
141,"Does anyone else feel like they have no personality because of depression? For me the downward spiral started when I was 11 or so, so being depressed is basically all I remember. I don't know who I was before that, or who I am now. 

I always just feel like a carbon copy of whatever person I'm talking to, putting on a fitting mask and trying to please them with the personality I fake for them. I can't, for the life of me, tell you a single characteristic of me, except for my anxiety and depression. 

When I'm alone, I tend to talk to myself (probably out of loneliness and the longing for actual human interaction, and yeah I know it's weird) and then I feel like a blanc slate. Like there's nothing to me. 

This is my first ever post on reddit and I'm extremely anxious about it, but I've wanted to tell this to someone for such a long time and now I found this sub."
142,"When I feel ok, I feel off. When I sink into a depressive mindset, in a twisted way my brain feels almost satisfied. It's like my life is so shit that if i'm not feeling overly depressed about it there is something off. Like I'm wasting time being ok or even happy. This might make zero sense, but it's a feeling I've had for so long."
143,"I was a high-achieving student in high school, went to university and shit hit the fan, graduated a year later than everyone else and is still unemployed 9 months later. I think about killing myself everyday, some days the thoughts are more active (with intention and a plan) and some days they're more passive. I look at who I used to be and get so sad. But I think ahead about the jobs and career choices, and I don't want to work in a cubicle 9+ hours a day for the next 40 years in a company that I don't give a shit about. "
144,"For a while now I feel like I am getting progressively stupid. Information doesn't stick, common sense doesn't kick in and overall I really struggle following conversations and responding correctly. I'm always lead in bed at night cringing about stupid things I've said, things I should of said, how slowly I've been to react to something and overall how useless I am. I feel like I'm turning into a sloth. My body is so heavy and every now and then I have to kick myself up the ass to get a move on because I've blinked and ten minutes has gone 
by. I don't recognise this mess that I've become and I just wanted to know if anyone else gets this and if so how to get out of it? I'm miserable and what's worse I'm frustrating for the people around me and getting a reputation of being slow and overall useless. Help 😞"
145,"I've been crying nonstop for 3months. Getting into university have made my condition worst. It's lonely here. I want to tell more but I just have no energy to type.

Hope those who read this.. good day to you.


Edit:
I didn't believe that my first post will get over 1K upvotes. Thank you for all the kind messages. Thank you. I have read all of it. Thank you. Truly made my day better. I will try to hold on and to those who are struggling too, keep your heads up too, try to love yourself, ourselves more. We can't lose hope."
146,"like, i wish that instead of having my crappy, depressing consciousness being tied down to my body, i could just exist as a floating, formless concept instead. right now my mind and body feel incredibly heavy and all i can do is lie down in the dark. i wish i could be free and light and weightless.

i don’t want to kill myself. i doubt i’d even have it in me to inflict physical pain on myself. but i don’t wanna exist like i currently do either. can anyone relate?"
147,I would like to hear your thoughts.
148,Yup... that’s me. I think this is the depression that completely scares me most because days pass and I don’t do anything at all and don’t accomplish anything because I don’t give a fuck and then I look back and so much time has gone to waste
149,"No real reason for posting I’m just proud of myself for making the choice I did.
Edit: this is not what I expected. Thank you to all these wonderful strangers for the support. In the real world, only my partner knows that I even have depression because I don’t want to stress people out. I’m honestly so overwhelmed. I thought I would answer some common questions in an edit, and I’ll slowly get to each comment as I can 😊. Firstly the cost- I’m an Aussie and I have private health insurance, which includes ambulance cover, so it cost me nothing. I can’t believe some people have to pay. I wouldn’t have called if I knew I did. Second - what happened after I called. I had my live in boyfriend with me, and they came in and asked me some questions (eg had I overdosed / self harmed etc.) I explained that I had accidentally missed a few days of my medication, and then had several extremely stressful incidents occur over the space of the days I forgot them. I called because I started to feel like I couldn’t trust my brain, and I had a plan I was worried I would act on when my partner left for work in the morning. I had also had a panic attack right before I called, which I had never had before and oh boy was that scary. So off I went. It was all very gentle and calm. I basically just needed someone to watch me while I waited it out / for my meds to kick in. I slept in a nice room, was allowed to keep my phone so I keep in touch with my partner. In the morning I was given my meds (I had remembered them the dish before). I had various meeting were they explained that they were happy I called, it was just a relapse, forgetting my meds didn’t help. I had a long meeting with a doctor where I went through everything (I was first diagnosed 5 years ago with PTSD and depression) and the difficulties I’ve had getting help. I had a good doctor for a while, but she moved. So they set me up with a new doctor with hours the work in my work schedule, and a new therapist, again that work in my work schedule (most psychs in my area that bulk bill don’t do after 9-5) (bulk bill = in Australia medical services and partially covered by our public health system (Medicare) is the doctor only charges what they cover, it’s referred to bulk billing. Basically it’s free (but covered by your tax dollars)) They also renewed my mental health care plan (my document a doctor gives that allows me to access the psyc services at little to no cost) which I hadn’t been able to renew as my new doctor couldn’t fit me in. Lastly I was put in touch with a community mental health program a few streets from me who have given me a case worker. I haven’t meet her yet, but basically she’ll contact me regularly to see if I’m ok, and can be the person to find me doctors and psychologists when I’m struggling too. I’ve nicknamed her my depression pa. Lastly they recommended I get my dosage upped a little bit. Then I was realised (it was about lunch time) and got sushi. They also rang my boyfriend a lot (plus me texting him a selfie every 30 minutes on his request) to keep him updated, and to run down my plan moving forward."
150,"Hair doesn’t style right, my makeup looks off, my outfit looks like crap. 3 hours of getting ready later....and I just cry and don’t end up going out. This is my life 90% of the time trying to go anywhere. I’m exhausted, and I hate it. Anyone relate?

Edit: Wow, by the likes it seems like I’m definitely not alone. Thank you for sharing. Sending you all well wishes that we can overcome this feeling and feel adequate, as I know we all deserve to feel accepted in society as we are. Hugs to you all 💜"
151,"Ever since I was young, I can't remember what age but definitely younger than 10. I would have this feeling inside me like emptiness and I didn't realise until I was an adult that this was depression when this feeling came back. "
152,"like i was at work and my body just shut down and decided not to try anymore so i just stared into space for what felt like 5 minutes, but was actually 30. fuckkkkk this"
153,"Even with my chemical imbalance I used to be an active, social person. I was fun-loving and outgoing and for the most part happy.  Now it seems all I do is go to work, come home and sleep. I want to do things I used to enjoy but I’m so drained by just surviving. I try so hard but I can’t push myself to. It breaks my heart and I grieve for the person I used to be because I don’t feel like she’s even a part of me anymore."
154,Suicide just seems so terrifying but living is so hard
155,"No, I'm in no danger of offing myself so no need to send out the cavalry. But I am so tired of having to remember what it feels like feel good instead of actually feeling good. I'm tired of having to remind myself that how I feel is not normal. I'm tired of having to remind myself my feelings are separate from me. I'm tired of having to distract myself from my feelings to get through today.  Every fucking day. I'm tired of feeling like crying everyday all day everyday. I'm tired of having to have some mild stimulant just to feel whole. 

Pardon the pun, but my depression is fucking depressing."
156,"I’ve been wanting to cry for a few weeks now and it’s become hard for me to cry. I don’t know necessarily know why I want to cry. The other day I was watching Endgame and Tony’s death always gets me sad but, I couldn’t cry like I did when I saw it in theaters. I want to cry but I physically can’t. Why?"
157,"like if they are judging me or don't like me, trust me i know. i hate all of those things about myself and more."
158,
159,Today I got told that “You only get depressed because you aren’t grateful for the things that you already have.”
160,"I am always the guy making jokes and making people smile and helping them out. Truth is. I just use everyone as a distraction from my own shit life. 

I'm an introvert pretending to be extroverted."
161,"It feels like i constantly have a negative feeling in my chest, that's constantly there all day, but feels like it gets way worse when I feel more lonely/sad/negative.

I've never hugged anyone before, so when i sleep i hug a really soft blanket I have, to feel at least somewhat better, but i always feel even more lonely and i usually cry, and I've noticed that feeling in my chest gets much worse when i feel worse emotionally."
162,"I just want to stop existing, no one would have any memories of me, nor feel sad as they wouldn't have known me.

Is it so bad to say, I didn't ask to be here, my life is shit and hard, I'm very sad and I just don't like this ""life"" game. I just want to go back to my pre birth state of not existing."
163,"Lately I’ve been neglecting sleep because I can’t overcome the anxiety of having to wake up and think about all the things i’m behind on whether it’s school or even socially. It feels like when i’m awake a long period of time I can just manage my stress. Unfortunately as i’ve been neglecting sleep it’s gotten me in trouble with my parents and it’s mostly because I have a hard time telling them the truth as to why I’m not sleeping.  Idk just feels like i’m trapped.

EDIT: I find it hard talking to my parents or a therapist because I hate when people feel bad for me. I’ve seen one therapist in the past and it sort of worked but I always feel awkward and embarrassed telling them my problems."
164,"I think about it a lot. My mom has a friend of hers who has 2 kids. One is in an Ivy League school and the other is going to a nice university. They both get good grades, have a social life, and know where they're going in life. 

Meanwhile my mom got stuck with a total wastoid that sits around all day on his phone. I don't drive, don't have a job, don't really wash myself unless it's been a few days or I have to go out somewhere. I have severe ADHD and don't really do well taking basic classes. I just feel so guilty that this is what my mom gets to deal with. She always tells me about how it was such a magical moment when I was first born. And I just think ""if only she knew how I would turn out."" It wasn't her fault, though. She is such a loving caring person. She didn't deserve this. 

Anytime my dad comes home from work I have trouble even looking him in the eye because I know I'm probably such a disappointment in his eyes. I act normal around him but the anxiety and dread is always there in the background. I wish I could just kill myself and end the bullshit, but that would just hurt them even more. No matter what I do, everybody loses. "
165,"Still want to die. Still a worthless, unemployed piece of shit with no potential. Still a burden to everyone in my life. 

Edit: went to bed after writing this post (I say bed because actually going to sleep is a rare occurrence) and did not expect so many replies. Thank you for your kind words. 

Edit 2: I'm in tears right now. I really didn't expect this kind of response and I'm feeling both grateful and a bit overwhelmed. I've been at the bottom of this hole for at least 4 years and things seem to be getting worse. Letting this out felt so good and I'm truly touched by everyone's comments. I'll be honest, I just don't have the energy to reply to everyone, but I appreciate this community so much. "
166,"Went to a doctor today because I suffered an injury while drunk.

The doctor (God bless him, amazing person) saw right through me and asked if I was Ok. Actually pretty much told me I'm not Ok mentally. Asked what happened to me, how do I feel, why do I drink. Gave me recommendations to a psychiatrist (for drinking) and to a psychologist.

It was nice for somebody to notice and to be so kind and interested. It was way beyond his job description.

I'm a bit sorry I opened up only in the most generic terms, but I was already on the verge of tears.

Unfortunately ppl close to me are oblivious even if I'm giving all the signs. They get annoyed with me if I don't wear my happy face, but I can not bear to put it on anymore.

God, I hope I can take something from this doctor and try one last time to fix myself, because I can't live like this anymore."
167,"Been feeling better recently, much better. Met a girl and opened up to her, she immediately left my house. Things like this can really scar a person. I care about you all, let me know if anyone needs to talk."
168,"Yesterday I had lost all hope and just went ahead and hanged myself from the ceiling fan.. made sure to lock everything so I can't be saved. As soon as I moved the chair under my feet I thought my neck would break cuz it was a high but it didn't happen, had a really bad choking experience and let me tell you it hurts like a bitch. 
Half a min in I went unconscious due to the severe pain, woke up to me lying on the ground my mum and dad crying and me choking on some blood( I don't remember how long I did stay that way but apparently not long enough). Had a long talk with my parents and tbh I feel very relieved as if the past me did die, I'm motivated for once and want to make my folks proud! 
I think I'm a little elated I didn't go away. I'll work my way upwards from now! Thanks for reading it all the way through, I think sometimes there's a little hope just need to find it, I think I've found mine.

Edit:- I'm 17yo, and thanks for the support everyone, really appreciate it!"
169,"go to school, put on a face, pretend that im all happy and nothing’s wrong. it sucks having to do this every single day. it’s so draining"
170,"I can not describe this better. Like I am literally fighting with myself physically so I do not lose touch with my surroundings and not get lost within my head.

It is so tiring.

Edit:

Damn, guys. I...am touched. I am just amazed to be honest how many of you struggle with the same shit every single day. Thanks for the kind words, for the support you show here. <3
You are all breathtaking. <3

Edit 2: I thought that this will be such an insignificant post. Turned out a lot of you feel like this. It is...sad and amazing at the same time."
171,"I've had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month. I got appendicitis and surgery; still recovering. Accidentally twisted my ankle. I got a cold, which I'm still fighting. However, none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor; they demand it from me 24/7, practically. Not asking for advice, really just ranting. These are just a few examples.

I had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing, and she was complaining about how she hates where she works. I tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else. It wasn't as short as it sounds. I listened to her and gave her serious advice, though I know she won't take it because she never does. Instead of thanking me, no one ever does, she tells me that it's easy for me to tell her to just get another job because I don't have one and can just sit around and sleep. Well, thanks, I just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life; it is a positive joy. We hadn't spoken until her son ended up in an issue and, of course, the family therapist (me) gets a text, asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to ""reason"". I agree just because I know my nephew doesn't get good support from her. Come to find out, she's mad because he's dating some girl who has a kid already. I can't say it's great at his age, but he's also an adult, so I just told him to be careful, watch out for emotional abuse, and reminded him of his last relationship, which was like a copy of his mom's relationships; she doesn't realize he gets his bad examples from her. After talking to him, his mom texts me and is like, ""I'm getting off work in a few hours, I'll call and we can do a three-way call and talk to him."" Nowhere did she ASK me if this was okay, didn't ask if I was busy or anything, but as with most of my family, since I'm at home, I never have anything important to do, so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking, like I'm a human being. I tell her I texted him and I was still recovering and needed to sleep. She didn't ask me what I was recovering from, if I was okay, nothing. Just said, ""Okay, night."" 

My niece had trouble at school and she's a lot like my sister, unable to let go of things. She's upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair. A chair this girl wasn't using, mind you, but that was just sitting next to her. My niece calls me, upset and frantic over this because the girl won't let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology. My niece refused because she said she hadn't even done anything and she went to the principal, who told her that the girl is known for ""keeping things going"", so she wouldn't be bothered again, but my niece wouldn't get off the phone until I promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them. A huge reason I don't have kids is so I don't have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents, yet I have to be a parent to my niece because my sister won't be. Mind you, I had just come back from the doctor, had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing, but sleep. I forced myself to stay awake, but thankfully, no one called.

Then, my sister calls me and is crying, telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house. So, I don't say anything and just let her talk. Finally, she's like, ""I just don't know what to do or how to get him out of my house."" I told her to call the police; she doesn't want to get him in any more trouble because he has a DUI because he drinks and drives. SHE allows him to drink and drive her car, because he doesn't have one and doesn't have a license. I won't even touch how stupid that is. So, I get frustrated with her and tell her that I keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens, so I don't know what she wants me to do. She acts like I offended her and is like, ""I just called to vent, can't I vent, sometimes?"" I tell her that she can, but I'm tired of getting calls almost every week about this man; I'm not her therapist or life coach or anything, I'm barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because, even if I don't like her very much, I don't want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff. Not to mention, her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot... make him leave before he gets to that point. Anyway, she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up. Maybe I did make it about me, but I want people to understand that I am not a therapist and I cannot fix their issues and I'm not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff. I'm not sure anyone is, tbh.

Finally, we come to today. My mother had to take me to the doctor because I couldn't get there on my own and need support to get there. We're talking about normal stuff, then she's like, ""Aren't you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing? You really need to get out and get a life."" I don't ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it's a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesn't understand why I'm ""letting it bother me"" as an adult. I'd like to mention, she has horrible anxiety, as well, but she powers through it to work, at least, it still takes over her life. She also doesn't do much outside of the house and has no life, but when I point that out, she brings it back to me. Anyway, I tell her I just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher, I don't have money to have a life, even if I wanted to. So, then, she's like, ""If you get a job, you'd have more money."" I know this, but I have tried many times to hold a job; I cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns, which either end up with me leaving or getting let go, which then leads me into a deep depression. She acts like I don't try and this is even with medicine and therapy. Sometimes, I'm sure the main reason none of this works is because I'm around my family, but I never tell them that because I don't want to deal with that fallout. At this point, I'm just tired of the conversation, so I don't respond. Then, she brings up how I need to get some friends, at least... says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her, even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her. Heavy eyeroll. Anyway, I tell her that I've tried to have friends; it's not my fault they don't put effort in and either they end up not talking or I fade out because nothing is happening. She asks me why I don't hang out with the people I met last summer. The two girls I met last summer were nice, but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend, which left me and the other girl. We hung out a few times, but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back, so I stopped texting her and let that fade out. This happens too often, so I stopped trying to make friends. I tell my mom that I don't talk to them anymore, and she's like, ""That's your problem, you don't try and cut people off so quickly."" I texted the second girl every day for a week; she wasn't working at the time and she was always posting snaps, so I knew she was available, I wasn't going to keep texting for no reason. I try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when I see things obviously aren't going along, anymore. She then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month, but they are still good friends and I need to be more ""realistic"" with friends. What good is a friend whom I only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with, maybe once every three months? If that works for her, great, but that's not ""getting a life"" or anything else. Plus, I have a history of getting friends and then I become the ""therapy friend"" and I fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice, then I don't hear from them for months, when something else is going wrong. That's not friendship, to me. 

And go back to my mom and my aunt. My aunt is mad at my mom for ""checking up on her"" at her age and, of course, I get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and won't talk to my aunt, so I've been designated the go-between, but I never said I would be. They are 20+ years older than me, why am I even in this?

I don't know. I'm just tired of being everyone's therapist and mediator. I keep trying to explain how draining it is. They obviously see I have my own issues, but they continually pour their issues onto me, expect sincere, helpful, empathetic responses, but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesn't answer their phones or I get ""advice"" that isn't helpful. My niece and nephew would probably talk, but I don't want to burden them with my issues; their mother does that to them enough, and they complain about it, to me, of course. What is it about me that makes everyone think I'm a therapist? Plus, none of them pay me for my services. That probably makes me more upset than anything; if I was a real therapist, I'd probably be rich off all these ""sessions"", lol."
172,"Now I'm not in school, can barley make rent, have no friends, family gave up on me. It's sad. It really is a travesty "
173,"After years of struggling with depression and anxiety I've noticed I can't concentrate and process information as fast as I used to.

Does anybody else feel like this?"
174,"MY BRAIN IS FUCKED

SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH MY BRAIN

I CAN’T DO ANYTHING

I CAN’T READ

I CAN’T SIT STILL

I CAN’T FUCKING FEEL ANYTHING

I CAN’T FUCKING DO ANYTHING IMPORTANT

I HAVE A SHORT ATTENTION SPAN

I NEED CONSTANT STIMULATION

I HAVE RACING THOUGHTS ALL THE TIME

I CANNOT FALL IN LOVE

I AM UNFIT FOR THIS FUCKING WORLD

MY BRAIN IS A SELFISH LITTLE BITCH

I’M FUCKING STUPID

I CAN’T DO ANYTHING RIGHT

I’M A FUCKING FAILURE

I NEED A NEW BRAIN"
175,Good quote by Robin Williams. Story of my life basically. I'm one of the goofiest/weirdest/most outgoing people you could meet and no one would ever guess what is going on inside my head.
176,"While cuddling of course. 

Edit 1: I fucking love all of you

Edit 2: So many people in the US, no one is down under :("
177,"I go through life with a lingering sense of worry, fear, doubt, uncertainty, regret, and utter lack of passion or drive. I am constantly worried about something going wrong. Lack focus and passion for what I do professionally and have no confidence in anything. I feel like i am going to get exposed as a fraud and get fired and not find another gig. Toxic mix of having no confidence combined with lack of drive to do anything about it creates chronic and lingering sense of anxiety and the vicious circle continues"
178,I always felt that I could have been something way better than I am now. I am barely scrapping by and spend most of my time in bed often daydreaming about how things could have gone for me if I had done things differently.
179,"You guys ever get outside, get that extreme spark of motivation like, “Fuck yeah! Things are looking up for me now. This world can kiss my ass because I’m gonna make it out of here!” Then, what feels like seconds later, something comes and rains shit on you. It’s like nothing ever lasts. When the fuck are people like us ever gonna get a break? Were shoveling shit all day, everyday and nobody fucking cares. But the instant we say we’re giving up, everyone’s like “Oh no! You have so much to live for! Think about x,y, and z! You can’t give up! Things are gonna get better!” Yeah, shove it up your ass. You’re just trying to make sure your conscience is clean when I’m dead and gone. You think you care, but you’re really just being cautious for yourself and trying to save your own soul while acting to save another. Good luck with that. I’m tired of being told to get help. With what fucking money? All just to talk to some damn superficial person who is literally being paid to be a friend to me because I’m so fucking shit at doing it without paying? What the hell is the point of trying? I’m stuck here, just like I’ll always be. Just give me the freedom to take my leave. I’ll be happy then, but I’ll be decaying in the ground by then. Ironic, huh? 

I wish things were different."
180,"I'll admit that even years ago I wasn't very happy and had problems, but I still miss the way I was back then. I still had things that made me happy, hobbies I enjoyed. And I actually had the motivation to do them! I could spend hours of my day doing something and completely forgetting the real world for a while. Now I can't find the motivation to do anything.

But I think most of all I miss how hopeful I was. Despite everything I fully believed that it'll get better, that the future will be a good one for me. And I've lost that completely. I don't have any hope anymore, I don't have any motivation, I don't have anything to look forward to. And I just really fucking miss that part of me"
181,"I'm so happy right now I completed my BA degree and I got a high mark for it overall. Those nights I stayed up paid off and I pushed through despite everything happening in my life. It was all worth it, I seriously doubted myself so many times but I did way better than I thought I would.

EDIT: Thanks for the support everyone I really appreciate it :)"
182,I feel like they would run away or be disappointed once they get to know me. What the fuck am I going to do with myself? Maybe I'll doe alone lol
183,"its hard to explain but its a feeling of not wanting the pain but wanting it at the same time, i feel like depression is very comforting, even though its not supposed to be, can anyone give me ideas on what this is?"
184,I just open up steam and endlessly stare at my library.
185,"i'm a really short guy, with an ugly face if I grow out my facial hair I look like a sick dog

i'm balding, my hair is thin 

my body is weak and scrawny, also my dick is small

everytime I catch my reflection on the subway I just want to vomit

I'M 27 but I look 47, also a KHV but this one goes without saying

people don't even see me, nobody can handle my no personality and social retardation

this is so unfair, and yes I wish I was born if africa at least I would've died at 8"
186,"I turned 21 today. I live in one of the biggest college towns in the country. When you turn 21 here, it's a big deal. I just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. I'm not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. Today I received three texts (more than most days): one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. In all fairness, I don't have a facebook and I don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. I guess I've never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. But I think in not having a facebook, I've sacrificed my social life absolutely. 

Anyways, I've spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we ""to cool off,"" and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers. 

Anyways, If you've made it this far, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for listening to me vent. 


EDIT: The Reddit community has been absolutely amazing. You guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe, I've been getting offers for people to buy me drinks, and some have even given me their cell numbers to talk/text me if I was still feeling down. You guys are unbelievable. You turned what was a miserable day for me into one of the most memorable birthdays I've ever had. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. For all of you who took the time to help a stranger on the internet, thank you. Your words of encouragement have lifted up my spirit exponentially. I can't say it enough: thank you, thank you, thank you. "
187,"I used to be able to actually do stuff. Even if I didn't want to, I went to bed early. I got up in the morning. I had hobbies and sustainable goals. I worked on my problems and found solutions.

That was 6 years ago. Now, I want nothing but to get better, but I just keep being my own worst enemy. I want to get a job. I'm 23 and have absolutely no work experience. I paid $2300 last year to improve my grades and I still haven't read a single page. I want to, so why can't I just fucking do it? I have ADHD as well, but that's been with me my entire life so I can't really blame it on that..

I just have no sense of self anymore. I do the same thing every single day. I get up at noon, play video games, go to bed. There's just no productivity, even though I hate living like this. I always tell myself ""I can't take this anymore. I'll start making changes."" What do I do the next morning? Eat like shit and play video games all day.

I don't know what the fuck I'm doing with my life. I'm not strong enough to get up and make changes. Not consistently, at least. I see a therapist every 2 weeks, but I feel like he's starting to give up on me.

Absolutely FUCK depression."
188,"Just because I laugh and smile occassionally doesnt mean I'm not depressed.

I dont have to mope around and cry 24/7. A majority of the time I seem/look happy I'm faking it anyways.

I just wanted to say this cause I know you guys can relate.

Edit: Whoever gave me Gold honestly made my night:) thank you!"
189,Like every morning I think oh fuck this again. I can’t do this.
190,"What I mean is that I constantly worry that I'm not actually depressed, that I'm just lazy and don't want to take the next step in life, that I don't want to put in the work to get where I know I want to be.
So I'm wondering if anyone relates to that"
191,"Things are getting better but there’s a part of me that doesn’t want to be happy, like I wanna stay depressed."
192,I would never try to commit suicide again but sometimes I wish something else would just do the job for me. 
193,"Because for me, probably like for so many of us here, it forces me to view my entire life as a waste of time. I wouldn't even say I'm looking for help or reassurance with this post, more just curious if this FOMO is widespread. 

I've devoted so much energy towards living the life found in college brochures - tons of social/hobby clubs, going out to bars and trying to dance with people, attending lectures and keeping an eye out for local events (whether because I'm interested in the event itself or because I feel like going would make me seem more interesting) - and I hate all of it. I haven't met a single person I enjoy spending time with. Even my academics make me miserable. To top it all off, when someone detects I'm pretending to have fun and calls me fake or disrespects me it stings for months afterwards. Because we know that's what life mostly is for us: a choice between faking happiness/confidence or revealing just how negative/pained we are and repelling all these people who want to have a good time."
194,So I’ve felt with depression for about 10 years now and it’s always so confusing when I push people away but still want them to care for me. Instead of going out and doing things with my friends I’ll stay at home and cry. Instead of reaching out to people I’ll think about how they probably hate me. Whenever I try to explain my depression to someone it feels like all I’m doing is complaining. I’m just so tired of feeling like this. Does anyone else feel like this? And if you have do you have any advice for me?
195,Small step for a man but a giant leap for my mental health 
196,"Go WHERE? I don’t like bars. I don’t like to drink too much. Especially if I’m driving. Where else do people go to socialize?? I don’t have friends or even know where to go to make friends. 

I try every opportunity I get it but I don’t get many opportunities because I have NO idea where to go socialize. 

I’m just sick and tired of being alone 24/7 and feeling completely hopeless to change it. This makes me sad as fuck. :/"
197,"It's that depression doesn't kill you desire to want to do things, it doesn't kill your dreams and what you want in life, it just stops you from doing them. It's like being in a cage and outside the bars you can see all the things you can do and want to do but the cage (depression) locks you in and stops you from getting at them and doing them. I dunno but to me that's one of the worst things about it :p"

204,"To someone who can make a difference or at least someone who enjoys life. I thought I was getting better but this morning I found myself drafting a note in my head. I'll crawl back out, I always do, but every time it just takes a little longer. I feel so powerless.

205,It took two hours but I did it !
206,"I get ill or upset over something? Mum yells at me.

I’m too tired because of work, sudden change in environment and social circle (went from having friends to not knowing anyone) and depression? Sister thinks I’m being lazy for just not wanting to do something last minute on my only day off. Or for not washing a mug and a plate straight away.

I’m not super happy and slightly frustrated over something? Friend says “why are you so snappy lately” or “what do you expect me to do”. Nothing. I just want some empathy since everything that happens in my life is going fucking wrong.

I feel like no matter what I do, I’ll always be annoying to everyone around me. I’m sorry for not being super happy atm, I’m just having a bad fucking time which apparently nobody understands."
207,"I just wish that I get removed from this universe, and no one remembers that i even existed. Everyday I want to commit suicide, but can't do it because of my parents. I know they won't be able to get over my death. I just wish they hated me ,instead of loving me so much, so I could die in peace. I don't deserve such good parents. I am a complete loser."
208,"Anyone else feel like this? Like it would be nice to just slip into a coma or die in a car crash. It wouldn’t be your fault, so you don’t have to grapple with the guilt of hurting your friends and family, but you want to be the victim of something and just close your eyes and let go? Idk maybe I’m rambling but I don’t think I have the nerve to kill myself because I don’t want my family to suffer and look for answers as to why I did it, but I definitely feel like I don’t want to be here anymore. 
I guess it doesn’t matter if anyone replies to this or not, I just feel like I needed to say it somewhere; I want to die but I don’t want to kill myself."
209,"We know that September 10 was World Suicide Prevention Day. And, we're all for activism. But not here, please and thank you. It takes focus away from our OPs in need of support and understanding. "
210,"Why do I feel even more inhuman when I'm with others?

I don't want to talk, I don't want to smile. I don't want one of my friends to listen. I'm sick and tired of speaking, of explaining.




Whenever I'm alone, I might have moments of sadness, but I also moments of joy.



When I'm with others, I forget what my thoughts are really about and it feels like I am caught to spend time with them.




I don't want people to occupy  me or make me happy.

I just want to be how I am. Angry, sad, tired. 


And just deal with my own thoughts without having to tell people how I feel and why I feel that way.





I don't even want help. Because everytime someone tries to help, it feels like they are forcing me into a certain behaviour that I don't want.



It's not that I see my depression as a disease or illness, I see it as a symptom for something deeper. For the fact that I simply don't want to be part of this society, be ""normal"", hang around with others. 


Meeting friends feels so pointless, so shallow. Like you are still suffering but you forget it for a few moments. I don't want to forget, because I actually think the suffering might wanna tell me something.




If your leg hurts because you broke it, you don't just swallow pills or hang around others and everything will be fine.



You have to see what's wrong and adjust it.
And right now, every form of human interaction feels like I'm doing a marathon with that leg..."
211,I need someone to pull me into their arms and just hold me for like a minute or two. fuck.
212,Like no matter how much sleep I get I’m always fatigued.
213,"I've been struggling with depression for about three months now. I've had severe depression, social anxiety and panic attacks in the past from 2016 to beginning of 2018, harmed myself and tried suicide a few times, but I started a treatment, took medications and got ""cured"". ~~I guess depression never leaves, right? We just learn how to deal with it and control it but it's probably never truly gone... that makes me terrified. But I might me wrong.~~ 

But now all of this feelings are coming back and I'm panicking. I have no motivation whatsoever to go to work (I'm arriving at least one hour late every single day), I cry every morning and every night, I'm becoming paranoid with my boyfriend and relationships in general, thinking no one would want to be with me 'cause I'm a failure, I get too anxious to reply to anyone, I'm feeling alone, abandoned, ugly, insecure, unworthy, stupid, weak...

I tried to create a to do list to get me occupied. Stop using the uber app to go to work when I can perfectly walk (it's just 2.7 kms - or about 1.6 miles), cook my own meals and stop ordering from an app or eating junk food, start exercising (my apartment building has a gym where I can use wherever I want), go to bed early, wake up in time, have breakfast before leaving the house, reply to all the messages I've been avoiding for months, start to be productive at work and stop scrolling through reddit, get out of my art block and start drawing again, post more things on my artistic social media so I can be more active, start applying for jobs (I don't get paid enough and hate my current job), finding a new apartment to stay (My roommate is my exe's cousin so its a bit... weird?). Just ""simple"" things I thought I could handle and that would make me feel way better with myself. But I can't. I literally can't. Every time I try to get out of bed in the morning I cry 'cause I simply can't. I walk in front of the gym and just want to cry, can't even step on it. Sometimes I can even put on my gym clothes. I turn on my computer I just want to die, my energy starts to drop drastically and its an exhausting task to read my emails and start working. I'm always procrastinating and pushing people away.

**I think the thing that's bothering me the most is that I can't achieve the simplest goals, and I'm failing even on the silliest things in day life**. **I don't have suicidal thoughts anymore, neither the urge to hurt myself, so sometimes I just feel like this might not be depression, it's just perhaps me not trying hard enough.** But either way I can't live like this anymore. I've been deeper before, but that doesn't mean my life is wonderful. It took me a few weeks to finally defeat my social anxiety and finally called the therapist. My appointment will be next friday. I'm very nervous, but relieved. I really hope things get better from now on so I can have a normal life again. :)"
214,"This was the caption of a photo that my classmate submitted for a photography class. (We have this Facebook group where we submit all our photography works)

**And it just resonated with me.** Depression is such an ass. Struggling with depression has fucked with my life so bad that I ended up self-harming and nearly killing myself three times this year. And I couldn't do it because I'm too afraid. I want things to end. But I couldn't. 

At this moment, I'm not suicidal. I'm not even at the point that I'm severely depressed to the point I can't function normally. It just resonates with my struggle, especially with my experience for years, but this year in particular... The fact that my mind has been telling me to die but my body doesn't. The fact that I still have it despite having great family, friends and a loving girlfriend. The fact that it has been affecting my life quite severely. The fact that it gives me anxiety and doubt for the future. And ultimately, the fact that I realize that its such a miracle that I'm waking up each day, still alive, and bravely battling depression.

Peace out, and much love."
215,"Yesterday I played video games with my best friend all evening, and afterwards I laid in bed still sometimes laughing about the things we did earlier. I suddenly realized an odd, light, positive feeling in my chest. I'd forgotten how nice good days could be, and how giddy, bone-deep happiness felt. I hope this is a sign I'm getting better again!!"
216,"Every now and then I start to feel a little bit optimistic about everything. I start to have all these ideas about how I will change things around and become a better person etc. Just to find that the morning after I'm as depressed as ever, if not more. It's like my depression is sometimes giving me a break just to come back and say ""Psyche! You still suck."""
217,"She wasn't sure what was making me upset, but she wanted to scare it off. Getting a dog hasn't cured my depression, but she sure has made it easier to deal.

I love this dog."
218,"I mean myself personally. Whenever I feel down I automatically start shaming myself by saying I'm only acting like this because I want someone else to feel bad for me. But I know that's not what I want, or at least I think it's not what I want. IDK. Does anyone else ever feel like this though?"
219,"It could be over the smallest thing. Whenever I hear someone talk about hobbies or anything I am just envious of them. I wish I could enjoy things, I wish I could actually have the desire to do anything. It hurts. 

I absolutely hate when people ask me “So what are your hobbies?” “What did you do this weekend?” Shit like that. I have no answer because I just stay in my damn bed whenever I’m not at work. The other day someone asked me “Have you done anything interesting lately?” I just straight up said “No, I’m boring” 

I hate it because it makes people not want to be friends with me. And I get it, why would you want to be friends with someone like that? I don’t blame them. But goddamn I wish I wasn’t like this. Its not a choice, I wouldnt wish this on anyone. It’s literally the worst. A curse. Why couldn’t I just be normal and have a happy life"
220,Probably sounds stupid but the only thing I look forward to everyday is laying in bed after doing nothing all day and just sleeping for 15 hours. I like dreaming. I wish I could sleep longer
221,"UPDATE: So, I thought it would only be fair to post this update. While one friend still doesn’t seem to give a fuck, I’m meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow. Turns out she’s been having a thyroid flare up. One other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so we’ll see about that. Some people care but have stuff going on, other people don’t care. Pay more attention to the former.

Original post:
Seriously, fuck everyone. It’s so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked, but who’s really willing to listen? Only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way. The rest of them are just faffers. Capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable, including friendships. Hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk. More often than not it’s people who have struggled with mental illness themselves.

Edit: It is usually better to talk to a therapist (if you can afford therapy, that is) about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with. I don't recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away. People have enough shit in their own lives to deal with. However, it sucks if you want to talk with a 'friend' who clearly knows you're going through a tough time and they don't return your call. 

Edit 2: Looking back at my post I realise I sound a little angry and cynical, but I really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need. A big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful. If you can, please seek the help of a therapist. It has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how I can strengthen my own self to ask of others what I need/deserve from them. It can be a long-drawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt. But please persevere if you have the means.

Thanks to everyone for your comments. I’m trying to reply to each one but it’s hard to keep up, so I’m sorry if I miss yours. Remember—you’re worth the effort and the struggle, so please hang in there.

Edit 3: If you're in the US, UK, Canada or Aus, you can use this directory to find a therapist near you, read about them, what insurance they take etc: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists."

224,"I've been clinically depressed for nearly 2 years now, I never enjoy anything and never look forward to anything

But I'm going to see Foo Fighters tonight and I feel not too bad at this moment, I would nearly say I'm excited.

225,"My parents keep asking me this question.
Today I decided to talk. 

I told them about everything and I answered their questions.
After I had talked they told me: ""You don't have the right to feel like that because there are people who are worse off than you.""

I didn't respond.

 They said: ""Oh great now you are trying the silent treatment!""
Then they left saying:""You can be such a dick when we try to talk to you.""

This is why I don't talk to you.

226,"I had resorted to self harming for a long time. Using knives were my poison. Right now I am struggling so much to not resort to it. I need help.

Edit: Wow. I didn’t expect this. Thank you everyone for all of these great tips and advice. And for those who are wondering I didn’t do anything and are still harm-free. I took a walk to get out of the funk or the lack for the better term. I might be getting into kickboxing. Been getting that suggestion from the people in my life and it’s something physical with a healthier outlet. It’s still not easy but I now know that I’m not alone. Thank you Reddit."

228,"I know that's not a solution to depression, but it's something I think about a lot as well as other things that depression consists of. 

I just imagine myself taking off, somewhere far away, near a nice beach, and just simplifying my life. Not telling anyone where I've gone, not speaking to friends and family ever again. Just...disappearing.

Some of you brought up the point that our problems are internal and not external. I know that, but that doesn't stop me and my mind from thinking of taking off. "
229,"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them."
230,I'm not fit for this world and wish I could leave without causing anyone pain.
231,"""depression doesn't exist"" ""you just want to be special and quirky"" ""you stay in bed all day cause you're lazy"" ""most people diagnosed with depression don't even meet the diagnostic criteria"" ""why can't you just be happy?"" ""depression is just an excuse""

&#x200B;

I think I've heard it all at this point. Really if depression doesn't exist, is that why I lay in bed all day starving myself? If depression doesn't exist, is that why I leave the duty that is showering at weeks at a time? I didn't realize being smelly was special and quirky.  If depression doesn't exist, is that why I won't leave my house? Do you honestly think laziness is the reason I was reported as a missing person to the police? If depression doesn't exist, why do I cry when I glance at myself in the mirror. Why am I isolating myself from family and friends? Why did I cut into my wrists? Why did I abuse substances, if depression didn't exist?

&#x200B;

An open letter to all those people out there saying ""just be happy"". That's cute. You've probably had a comfortable life, with parents who loved you. Unlike me, whose relationship with my parents has always been toxic. My dad first invalidated my diagnosis at 16 by saying depression didn't exist. He also threatened to kick me out onto the streets, and then again 2 years after that when my anorexia got worse. He just keeps me around cause I have some leftover money from school and he wants it.

&#x200B;

I've come close to suicide a few times. Once when I was 16 and another time when I was 20. Recently it's been on mind, as I'm hitting new lows, but I don't think I could ever do it cause I'm just so in love with my boyfriend. Though, if he ever betrayed me who knows what I'd do. I don't know myself. It feels like I have no one, except him, and I know what men are like after being cheated on before in past relationships."
232,"I just hate everything. I’m so tired of the same old boring life that causes me to suffer. 

Every day I am forced to do things I hate, talk to people I hate, go to places I hate and to put on my fake smile and pretend everything is ok. Lately I have noticed that I’m being irritated by almost everything. I just can’t stand it anymore. 
I hate everyone around me, I hate society, I hate this world, myself and my existence. 

I can’t remember the last time I was honest with someone about the way I feel. If I stop acting like I’m ok and someone notices I’m not feeling well, I’ll just say that I’m tired or my head hurts or other shit like that. It’s not like someone fucking cares about how I feel anyway, it’s all fake and pointless. 

I absolutely hate myself because I’m worthless. I’m ugly, I have no talents except being useless and doing absolutely nothing. I can’t even stand looking at myself in the mirror. 

Everything has lost its meaning lately. Does my existence even matter? If I suddenly disappear it would be better not only for me but for the world as well. 
I don’t even want to pursue my dreams anymore. I don’t want to achieve anything anymore. I just want it all to end. 

I have been thinking of killing myself for a while now, everyone will die when they reach a certain age, what does it matter if it’s now or then? But there’s one thing that’s preventing me and that is my fear. I’m scared of death and pain. I’m scared of what will come after I die. And that makes me hate myself even more, because I’m such a fucking coward. "
233,"In laying here about to sleep and every night I have the mantra in my head of that I hope I never wake up. I don't want to kill myself but I'd rather just never wake up again. That way no one will be mad at me for dying by my own hand. That way I can't disappoint anyone anymore. 

Anyone else?"
234,"It literally terrifies me that I have no idea what I’m doing with my life and I just feel like I’m losing it. I have no marketable skills or I’m too mentally ill to understand what worth I possess and every day it’s just this terrible feeling of life passing me by. 

I feel like I’m painfully aware of being swallowed by this deep, bottomless pit and I still can’t do anything about it. 

I wish I was better than this.

Edit: I wrote this yesterday when I was having a really bad moment. I’ve basically read all the replies and you’re all very kind. Thank you all for your advice and especially for your compassion. For those of you who mentioned you feel like you wrote this, or you empathize, I’m sorry that anyone has to feel like this. It sucks."
235,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, [please ask us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression). 

*****

Sorry about letting the last post get archived.  We've been super-busy keeping up with the modqueue and that's slowing down our work on making the community rules more clear and visible and migrated to the standard reddit rules system - we *are* spending all the available time we have on that.  In the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under ""Community Info"" on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit.  

I'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us.  Please use reddit's ""report"" function when you see anything like that.  The exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get.  

*  Helpers inviting private contact as a first resort.  Nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this.  Please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the OP decide when it's time to go private.   

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  These are specifically against the rules.  

* Posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support.  Everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic.  You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything.  For example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons.  Those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place.  

**Edit:**  I wrote this in a comment reply below but I want to highlight it here:  We enforce the rules as leniently as possible in the case of people who have come here to get support, but strictly in the case of people who are here for any other reason. We think it makes sense to ask people who are giving help to police themselves, but we try to cut people in need of help as much slack as we can without allowing discussions that take focus away from others in need of support. 

If you have concerns or questions about community business or moderation, please talk to us [in modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression) before you make a post about it.  

Thanks to everyone for their courage in sharing their struggles, and their kindness in supporting others.  "
236,"I woke up a few hours ago and ate too many chips and too much chocolate pudding until I felt sick.

Then I read the news and felt sick.

Then I read r/popular and felt sick.

Then I looked at the mirror and felt sick.

What's up with this crap? What do people see there? It's the same old shit every day. I'm not even hopeless I'm just annoyed because everyone is so delusional.

Life is more of this. Locations, schools, work places, are just wallpapers that are changing. Personality, clothes, haircuts, are just avatars that are changing. Success is just reaching higher levels in the same shitty game. The emptiness, the pain, the anxiety, stays the same.

Life is stabbing you, hurting you, mocking you, and offering you ice cream. Then people ask if you're depressed because you don't like ice cream. No, I don't like ice cream fucking hell, why don't you stick it up your...

Sorry, I just needed to vent a little.



EDIT: I just want to remind everyone that this is a venting post. Maybe it's not wrong, but it's also not a normal or healthy way of thinking. A depressed world view can be *valid* while depression is *still an illness*. It's an illness that can, in many cases, be treated. It's always worth to try to make life less miserable."
237,"I feel like I don't think as much anymore, like depression killed all my brain cells. I'm just numb and floating and not interested in anything. I can't remember words very well. Sometimes it literally feels like my head is full of air. 

EDIT: wow I didn't think this would get so much response! I made this post while I was in the middle of a brain fog at work instead of actually doing something important! Now I feel like it had a purpose to help you guys feel less alone. I'm sorry you're all feeling the same way, I know how hard it is. Thank you all for taking the time to share your experiences, it really made me feel less alone.

I truly don't think any of us are dumb or stupid or whatever you want to call it. We just have to recognise that it's this horrible disease doing it to us. I wish I could hug each one of you individually <3"
238,"I feel like the majority of my life so far was a movie of events just happening all leading up to the final end to the movie of me killing myself.  I would just die and I would never have to get to this part of life; it would just happen like that. but now I feel like I missed that chance and my movie is still going but the rest of the movie wasn’t planned out because it should’ve ended with my death so the story is just improvised, and now i feel even more lost and unmotivated than before. (because in all honestly I feel like I tried so hard with school and activities and work etc as one final push before i would kill myself but then I never went through with it and now I’ve given up trying on work and stuff) I don’t know whether others feel this way, but maybe in another alternate reality I did kill myself at the right time and that’s why I feel so wrong because I didn’t. who knows"
239,"I used to believe that if someone tried hard enough they could do anything, I no longer believe that. I think hard work, wit, the help of others, and luck can allow someone to succeed in their endeavors but not hard work alone. This was quite a blow to me. I'm trying to replace this myth with something else at the moment."
240,"People often say to take your mind off depression, go do something. Play music, focus on school, etc. But the issue is that these are all just blank substitutes that comes crashing down. Just as alcohol is a temporary fix (although it is destructive), using music, exercise, etc is JUST as pointless. I work out and then I feel great and then afterwards, I remember my situation and my life and I feel depressed again. If it’s not resolved, NO amount of “substitutes” can help. All these activities are are just temporary bandages on a wound that can’t close.

Edit: wow I didn’t expect this to get so many likes. My first post with over 1k likes! I’m happy to know that so many of you can relate with me in this way."
241,"I've always had depression, for as long as I can remember. But this year it's getting a bit worse I might say. I'm kinda in a haze, it's all foggy, my brain feels like cotton, I'm numb and in pain. I'm here but at the same time I'm not, I'm not myself anymore. The depression is choking me, the anxiety is killing me. I don't want Christmas to come this year.   
I  have this feeling that I don't want to be here to celebrate Christmas this year. People are nagging me about what I want for Christmas... I have no answer, because I don't need or want anything and I don't want to be here to open them anyway. Whenever I get a present from someone, I just feel guilty. Because trashy people like me doesn't deserve it, I just feel like a burden for everyone around me. I'm a waste of space, waste of oxygen. The guilt of taking up space is getting worse by the minute.   
I've told most people in my family I don't want any presents this year. They don't know it's because of the guilt. I'm tired of all the guilt! Guilt for breathing, existing, for being stupid and just for being me.  
People around me has been decorating for Christmas these past few days, I haven't. I don't care and I don't see the point.  I don't want to celebrate Christmas this year. I see no point. No joy, no happiness, no... nothing.   
Now I understand why people kill themselves around Christmas. 

My lack of will to live is kinda scary. It's never been so deep and strong before. The fact that January is gonna be financially hell doesn't exactly make it better. I don't want to live to experience January. I can't, I can't afford it. I can't handle it! Oh here we fucking go again, my brain is getting on overdrive and running around again. Push it away, just push the thoughts away. Cut, bleed and shut off my brain.   
Merry fucking Christmas to me."
242,"I wish there was an off switch that could be turned back on at will, ya know? Like a less permanent way to disappear. Just get off the grid for a while but then come back once I’m feeling better. Is it just me?"
243,I can’t remember the things I did since 2013. Where did time go?
244,I just want to move to a town where no one knows me and start fresh. I’m struggling so much
245,"All this pain and suffering, hurting other people, wasting people's time, dragging myself through life just to be in the same place 8 years later. This fucking medicine doesn't help. Nothing helps. I'm just tired of it."
246,"[26M] Anyone else just feel like their whole life is on hold because of their depression? I honestly have given up entirely on typical, conventional life goals such as finding love, home ownership, and a fulfilling career. I just want to throw in the towel already."
247,"It has happened more than once, usually I just try and get my mind off it and move on but sometimes it’s hard. 

What do you guys do?"
248,"This quote has always stood out to me as one of the most eloquent and simplest depictions of depression I've ever encountered in literature. One of the few times I'm actually startled by my own reflection. Just thought I'd share.

I'd love to hear any poignant quotes or excerpts you guys may have too."
249,
250,I hate the saying suicide is selfish because no one ever congratulates you for staying alive for others despite how fucking exhausting it is to simply exist. I've been depressed for past several years but one thing I've always had is my family which I'm grateful for and also ashamed to be depressed because how fucking dare I not be happy with all I have. Anyway I've purposely hid this from them because I don't want them to think of me as anything but the class clown type who's always seemingly upbeat and has his life together. The fascade is exhausting. I've wanted to die for a while but simply cannot bear to put my folks through especially my younger brothers who wouldn't even understand. Maybe this is enough maybe this will push me through until I get better. 
251,"It happens every time. They say to reach out if you're struggling but as soon as you do everybody lets you down. People either make it a competition about who has it worse, or try and tell you that you don't have ""real"" depression. Another one is when people downplay your condition saying there are people who have it worse. For some reason it always happens with this illness. Can this stop already?"
252,"I took three bottles of various pills in my cupboard, downed a fifth of tequila, and put a pipe to my car’s exhaust into the driver’s side window and cried tears of joy that it was finally going to be over.

I passed out and woke up in the ambulance strapped to a gurney, confused, sobbing, and hysterical. My housemate got home early and found me. I was admitted into the ICU, spent my birthday, Christmas, New Years, etc in the psych ward for three months going through ECT.

All I can think of lately is not messing up this time. It hurts because I’m a perfectionist, and I couldn’t get it right."
253,"like it’s fucked up, but i wish i would get cancer or have someone hit my car and push it off the edge of the canyon or something.
a terminal illness or an accident would do the job and make it so that my mom wouldn’t be as sad.
i just want to die but i don’t really want it to be my fault necessarily."
254,"Just hearing a voice from a youtube video or a series provides me with a little bit of comfort. It feels like I'm not entirely alone then. My friends can't really get through me and I'm constantly tired. In order for things to change I need to do something, but to do something I need energy... so yeah...

I want to sleep the entire time and I'm much more exhausted in general, but I'm also afraid. Will I feel better when I wake up or worse?"
255,"I don't know if these are just symptoms of depression, but I feel so distant from people that I used to consider friends. They never come in contact with me and I can't bring myself to contact them either, and when I do, it's often just short lived conversations or I end up being left on read. My main circle of friends kind of broke off, and now they never seem to plan anything with me. I feel so alone, but at the same time, it feels so hard to talk to people or even get out and try to meet others. As for finding new friendships and relationships, I feel like I've met someone but I find it so hard to trust them and I feel so scared all the time that it's never going to work out or if they're even interested. I honestly feel like I'm not even a priority for them but I feel so guilty and self-absorbed for feeling this way. I don't know if I should tell them because it might make me feel clingy. I don't know what to do and I feel hopeless.

EDIT: thank you for gold, hopefully our shared experiences can help our fellow brothers, sisters, and siblings get through these hard times"
256,"My mother decided to take me to the hospital tomorrow, so at dinner, I asked my parents which hospital we will go, father astonished, he didn't know we have such a plan. I fucked up.

He started yelling: ""she's not crazy!!!"" ""she's not sick at all!!!"" ""she's normal!!!"" blah blah. Mother yelled back, and all of a sudden, they turned at me. I don't need to mention the rest.

I can't stop crying, I'm so fucking desperate, my mother uses my father's high blood pressure to threaten me, said if I can't be a nice daughter he will die from stroke because of me. I know, I know I've done nothing wrong, but I can't stop thinking about that possibility, I feel guilty, it's all because of my existence, I won't commit suicide tonight but I don't know about future, fuck, fuck."
257,so you never do message your friends back and you start to feel isolated then you have a high where you talk to people again then a week later the cycle starts all over or is that just me
258,"The best explanation I could come up with when a friend of mine asked. 

EDIT: I'm glad so many of you could relate. Keep on fighting to find your home. "
259,"There have been like, at least three suicides on the tracks this month and I so very much want to be one of them...but as much as I want to commit suicide I don't want to commit murder, and it would kill my mom if I did it, so here I am facing another lonely worthless year. I'm so tired of this, I'm just so, so tired. I don't know why I'm posting, like I said I'm not going to do it, I won't do that to my mom...but I really wish this could be over."
260,"When you’re 18, you can make mistakes. You have the time to fix them. They don’t define the rest of your life. You have a decade + to build a life for yourself. There is always that hope that one day, things might turn out well for you. There is excitement. Life is full of colour, but off in the distance you see a storm and road in greyscale.

Then you turn 30 and suddenly the road ahead that looked dark and stormy ahead of you IS the road you’re now walking down. And all you can see is darkness for the next 50 years of your life.  Nobody is coming to save you or bail you out. 

I would give anything to go back and do things over. But there is no reset button, you can’t start a new save file. All you can do is turn off the game.

For people in their late teens/early twenties - don’t waste a moment. Appreciate the time you are living in and the fact that you have several important years to work with. They disappear without warning and one day, it will hit you like a fucking dump truck in the chest that you have lost them forever."
261,"Maybe this has been talked about in other posts but i'm new to reddit and for once wanted to be transparent about my brain. 

Does anyone else feel like your head is a fog? or like your living a video game (controlling all the moments and decisions but not emotionally attached) The feeling of un-motivation, detachment and numbness has only gotten worse (i'm 21 now). I notice myself making poor decisions due to lack of caring and foresight (even though i know what the outcome will be) Sometimes even as far as not being able to think, as if my brain is just a static tv. 

(i say sometimes to all of this because i have moments of feeling 'normal', or even periods of time. But it always leads back to that same empty hole)

I feel like my brain is broken, like i've been missing out on how everyone else feels."
262,"Whenever I think back to when I was younger and happy, I realise that my life is worse now and itl never be how it once was.

Just found my old Pokémon pearl cartridge in a box and looking at it made me remember how much I enjoyed life when I was 7, now I feel like shit"
263,"I was quite shocked at their reactions. I sorta expected a very stigmatized reaction for some reason. The first professor blew up on me in immediate concern for my well-being. He too had actually been through similar circumstances when he was younger. And the second professor, he had a close friend who was suicidal and very depressed as well. He was very calm throughout the whole conversation actually. That was a really fucking cool thing to have a legit chat about mental health with college professors. 

Edit: I really can't express enough how reassuring all of your supportive comments are. I would like everyone to know that I actually just recently started therapy for the first time this semester. And it is doing wonders. Hopefully I get the courage to schedule with the on campus psychiatrist soon to see if medication can help. Also, thank you all for reminding me that people do care about others. Thank you greatly."
264,"It makes me feel like a freak, and so unloved."
265,"I was bullied in elementary school, and I always used to tell myself that it's only temporary, that life will be good later, like in the movies. All I have to do is wait until I'm 16, I'm gonna have friends, have a girlfriend, go to the parties and gradually get into life as an adult.

I'm 27 now. No friends, no girlfriend, I lost my job recently due to a work injury... the life never really got better. I'm no longer being bullied by other kids, I'm being bullied by my own head. Every year is another wasteful, unfulfilling stepping-stone on the road to death.

It doesn't get better."
266,"I can't go on. Im after finishing a 26oz bottle of vodka hoping to numb the pain even a little but it fucking ddidn't work. Im in a secluded parking lot in my car staring at my gun and ignoring all 100+ missed calls and shit I cant deal with it. Im going to kill myself within the hour. 

Suppose I feel like I had to write this down somewhhere.


edit: Please see update comment.
"
267,"So, basically, my school is crap.

Teachers don't care about me being left out or bullied half of my time here. I didn't think the students did, until today.

There was an odd number of girls today since one was off, and we had to go into pairs. Of course, none wanted to go with me and neither did any one of the boys. So, I sat at the side and said I was fine not doing it.

However, one of the boys asked why I couldn't go in a three with one of the girls' pairs (if you couldn't tell I'm female, and in my school girls and boys don't like to go together much), but all of them said ""no this is a paired activity""

So he actually got really mad and called them all assholes and said how he noticed how they all treat me like shit and asked if I wanted to go in his pair.

He got a detention (just at lunch break) for swearing in front of the teacher and multiple small children passing by, but it honestly warmed my heart so much and it showed me that maybe there is some good left in humanity, and that someone actually cares.

It was the first time I'd felt happy in a long time, to be honest."
268,
269,"Even despite an official diagnosis, I constantly think, anytime I want to share my thoughts, that I’m just desperately seeking attention and being dramatic for the sake of getting attention and reassurance from my loved ones. It makes me feel guilty the moment I open my mouth to talk about how I’m feeling. Anyone else?

It makes it worse that every time I talk to my partner about it, she always twists it into some underlying meaning that I don’t want to be with her. And I get livid that she’s made it about her. Maybe I am just selfish and attention-seeking. "
270,and then you try to get up to do something for once but as soon as you sit up on the bed you feel no energy whatsoever so you just lie back down and quietly wish for death lol
271,
272,"I'm a sophomore in college right now and I am constantly surrounded by wise people... People who did things with their lives in high school and didn't waste it away crying, starving themselves, neglecting their work... They were able to partake in extracurriculars in spite of nervousness or not being nervous at all. They were able to accomplish things efficiently without attention or memory issues. They were able to make friends without poor social cues.

I had friends who manipulated me and threatened to commit suicide everyday, and even then I never had positive influences to help me. My parents were so busy with work that since my youth I was always alone at home. I have trouble having fun... I can't emotionally feel like a happy person, it's always forced. It doesn't come naturally to me so people didn't like people like me.

I'm too lazy to write this but basically I feel so bitter. I wish I did more so I could show off my potential but nope, I wasn't certain of myself ever. I'm trying to improve but my past latches onto me. ): Sigh.

Edit: I have something to add. First, I am very happy to see that some people can relate to at least the topic sentence of this post. We all feel like we were taken back by years because of some shitty stuff in my past. I also didn't get to finish writing this (because I hadn't the energy to finish) but there were moments where I stopped eating, showering, and brushing my teeth for very long periods of time. I also hid my feelings all the time. When people used to say, ""You don't understand!"" it would hurt so much because I really did in some way, or so I thought. I had speech therapy in middle school and general therapy in high school but I was never very honest because I was always afraid of the consequences. I feel a little bit of pride I guess saying this but I feel like I'm an example of someone who hid all their feelings and just wants it all, like all vomited and shat and sweated and cried out of me until I can remove it completely. Nowadays I struggle to even read sometimes, I just don;t have the strength, but I try.

I do say though writing this was therapeutic because I am severely overwhelmed saying this but thanks for reading."
273,"I know the past is the past and i only have moment but i wish i could just hit a reset button and go back 5 years. Oh how different my life could of been. 

The mistakes i made. It sucks. I've been through waves of depression but but deep down i've always thought maybe things will turn out but this is the first time i feel like that little dying ember inside me is completely burnt out."
274,R.I.P Robin Williams
275,"Anyone else feel the same way?

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses, guys, for once I don't feel alone :)"
276,I also feel like I'm getting judged for it and excluded from family events.
277,I used to distract myself by watching tv shows to escape from reality but my attention span has gotten so fucking bad I can’t even do that anymore. Why can’t I just die in my sleep and put an end to this miserable existence. I doubt anybody is gonna read this but it’s 3 am and I just needed to rant.
278,"Like washing, eating, staying on schedule, and so on.. It just doesn't matter. I think I could go on not washing for a month if my guilty conscience didn't tell me to at least act like a human being."
279,"Just felt like venting. No one knows how I scored, including my friends and parents. Everyone thinks I’m effortlessly and naturally smart. I wish they could see how much I’m struggling."
280,"Hey all. A couple of years back I had some very long and intense bouts of depression that seemed to cripple me completely. A significant part of my experience was apathy; I knew somehow that I was in a lot of pain, but I couldn't feel anything most days. When I could, it was anger. I isolated myself from everyone and lost a lot of friends during that period.

I still have a very hard time with depression, although it's been more manageable nowadays. I transferred schools and got engaged to my favorite person in the world. I still feel like garbage a lot of the time but I have to stop thinking that I'm *actually* garbage. I'm trying.

Anyway, about a year ago I tried to illustrate some of my experience in a [comic](http://imgur.com/a/RF48C), and I just wanted to share it with you guys."
281,"I've made a horrible habit of holding back the occasional smile or laugh because I don't want anyone for even a split second to mistake that for me being happy. As a result I continue to suffer more yet I still don't change. Then I feel poorly about myself for ""manipulating"" those around me. Anyone relate?"
282,"Most mornings I wake up feeling absolutely mentally content, then within about 5 minutes all the shit just hits me.

A mixture of anxiety and depression.

I feel that cozy feeling mentally when I wake up but it dissapears. I used to feel like that inside all day long."
283,"I hate that I am this way. I push people away, but then complain about being lonely. 

edit: Just want to say thanks for all the comments. It makes me feel a lot better that others feel the same way as me and that we can all help each other out "
284,"So that happened... I had a really bad day and told my friend that I basically have no reason to live and that I want to kill myself. She told another friend, and she said it to my teacher. 

The teacher immediately called my parents. Now they're mad at me for everything. My friends are mad at me. My teacher is mad at me. Everything has gone to shit...

I just cannot say what I'm thinking, because it always hurts someone. I won't be able to hold it in for long. Guess this might be my last week on this world. I hope that without me everyone will finally be able to get some rest"
285,"It feels like everyday is the same, the same battle with myself. Everything might be changing around me but for me I cannot tell the difference between yesterday, last week or even last month."
286,"At one time, I feel all right.

A moment later, I feel like I'm the worst (fill in the brackets) again."
287,"She literally left five minutes ago, I don't know why but I feel happy, I feel proud of myself. A few weeks ago I was so crippled by social anxiety that I couldn't even bear to try and text anyone but now, I worked up the courage to ask an old friend to hang out and she said yes. She got to my house at 2 pm and left at 9:30 pm, that's like 7 whole hours!  I can't believe I did it. I had fun and she said she had fun too. She even hugged me when she left, nobody's hugged me other than my parents in two years. My mom cried because she was proud of me and I feel like crying too. We talked about the usual stuff (school, boys, makeup, memes, etc.) and for one of the first times, I felt like a normal teenage girl doing something that normal teenage girls do. 

For today, I wasn't the girl that was locked in the psych ward for a while, I wasn't the girl who lost everything when I was 13, I wasn't the freak who never talks at school, I was me. I just acted like myself and it worked? I feel a mixture of happiness and sadness right now, happy that I did it, sad that it's over. Where do I go from here? I have a friend now, that's good right? 

I feel a little bit proud of myself, is that weird? I just kinda feel good that I did it. I know that this post will get lost in this sub and probably nobody will see it but I just want somebody to know what I did today. I feel at peace. I just got a new fantasy romance book (my favorite kind of book) from the library, I have my comfort plush next to me for support (along with bulbasaur and pikachu plushies i got for christmas 😀) and I feel *peaceful* for once. I think i'm going to read my new book now, I feel like maybe I deserve it. Maybe I really do..

EDIT: wow haha, this kinda blew up overnight! Just saw this now as i've been spending almost all of today reading that book, I can't put it down! only a few more chapters left to go lol. I'm not really sure how awards work on reddit, but I know you're supposed to say ""thanks for the gold, kind stranger"" so thanks for the gold, kind stranger! I'll do my best to respond to all of these comments, you guys are the best, and seeing all of your kind words really warms my heart so much <3


POINTLESS EDIT #2: woah, I've cried because of some of your comments! (don't worry, all happy tears) it means a lot. As for the book goes, I loved it and just finished it a few minutes ago, i'm going to the library in a few more minutes to get the second one, it's called ""Caraval"" for those who care. I guess this has a meaning because when I feel especially depressed, I want to get swept away into a fantasy world just like that book does, I really recommend it, it uplifted me (no this isn't an ad for the book i just really love reading)"
288,"To my beautiful boy. My sweet, sweet little man. 

I’m sorry I’m not the best mum. I’m sorry I get so distracted. I’m sorry that sometimes my head is too cloudy to give you my all. I am really trying. This isn’t anything how I pictured parenthood being. I am struggling to keep up with the image of being ok 24/7. Just know that I love you. I stay alive for you. I keep myself in my place for you. Because I’m your mama. 
Sometimes I feel like I don’t deserve you. Sometimes I feel like I’m doing the worst job. Sometimes I feel like I’ve failed you. I want to sing songs to you. I want to talk to you. I want to do all of these things that mother and sons do together. Sometimes I struggle to eat a full meal and I feel guilty that I don’t have plenty of milk to feed you properly. You cry. I feel ashamed. I feel like I’ve let you down. I wake up thinking “I don’t want to get out of bed today” but I do, just for you. Because I love you. But why do I feel so hopeless? Why does my heart ache for you every single day? My baby, this is draining my soul. The anxiety I go through just to get money for us. Sitting in the office and having a series of attacks. Mummy is tired. Mummy is drained. Mummy wants to be happy just for you. I want to be all these things for you just so you feel whole. I didn’t want this for us. You don’t deserve to be put with a mum like me. I am a terrible mother but I’m trying my best for you. Postpartum depression is evil. It’s robbing my mind and it’s hurting mummy. I turn on my phone and it’s the only thing I’m glued to. I feel like the worlds worst mum. I feel guilty that I can’t even look you in the eyes sometimes just because of how bad I feel that you’re stuck with someone like me. You deserve better. My misery makes me forget to just hold you and give you a cuddle. Not paying enough attention brings me down even more. You’re a blessing. You’re the greatest gift that I’ve ever been given and I’m guilty because I’m not doing my job properly. I feel ungrateful. I love you so much, my honey. I feel so helpless because I have no one to talk to. I get told to get over it or stop being so sad and enjoy all of these moments. But it’s harder than it seems. I didn’t ask for this. I am trying my darling. I am trying so hard for you, you will see one day. I want to get help. But I’m afraid of being turned away. Afraid of people saying that it’s all my fault or that I’m just being stupid and emotional or to stop crying because trust me, I wish I could. Time is so precious and I’m wasting it by moping around. I’m wasting all this time to watch you grow by being distracted with my own thoughts. You are growing so fast. In the blink of an eye you’ve grown from size 0000 to 00 in just under 2 months. No matter what I am your mummy. I feel defeated and drained but I will always love you. I will always nurture you. I will always care for you. I feed you. I do everything for you despite my heart ache. I do all of my duties as a mother. I am strong just for you even though I ride through all of this pain. You keep me going. This isn’t a cry for help but just a reminder that I am trying my best to be strong. 

A mothers love is like no other. It’s true. Without you I probably wouldn’t even be here. You’ve taught me that no matter what I have been put in this world for a reason. To be your best friend. You deserve the entire world. 

Mama loves you, my darling."
289,and then you just stay in bed and browse Reddit and pointless crap the whole day and then feel guilty for procrastinating. But then you promise yourself to do it tomorrow or some other day and it happens again and the cycle just keeps repeating and you just keep feeling guilty again and again
290,"There was more blood than toothpaste in my mouth by the end but hopefully I can keep doing it. The pain felt good.

edit: whoah that blew up..."
291,"Ever since leaving school and entering “the real world”, I have realised I’m just not cut out for it and honestly I wish I was never born.

I’m in my mid 20s now and the thought of possibly living another 50+ years until I die of old age, terrifies me. 50+ years of anxiety, dread and self-hatred...what kind of life is that?"
292,I feel like nothing makes me happy; even when I'm laughing and enjoying something like a movie or some shit I still just feel incredibly upset and depressed. Sometimes I actually feel worse.
293,My dad died when I was 11 and mom died two weeks ago from an incident with a neighbor. We buried her yesterday. Its easter weekend. My girlfriend wants to go to a party but I just want to chill. I don't know if its a good idea to go or not. Shes understanding and will stay home with me. I just think its too soon to be around a party group. Also I'm 28 so I don't have a lot of life experience.
294,
295,"It's my 17th birthday today and first of all none of my friends except 3 wished me. At home my stupid dad was to drunk to acknowledge me and I am sitting here on my birthday in tears, feeling alone.

\*Edit: Thanks a lot for all the nice comments, it is crazy how people on the interent can be so kind and it has meant a lot

\*Another Edit: It is the day after my birthday and I woke up to like +300 messeges. Holy crap thanks a lot I don't think you understand how much it has cheered me up! I will make sure to reply to everyone, but I don't want to rush it, but from the bottom of my heart....Thank you."
296,"And in a different time period, prior to the internet being a thing. 70s or 80s maybe. I spent my entire childhood locked away in my room with a glowing blue screen."
297,"i dont think about much anymore. the things i do think about are unimportant.

because of this, i dont have anything intelligent to say. im not funny or clever or smart. i probably seem very stupid and shallow and boring and i dont like this.

i wish i had the motivation to find things interesting and not be so one-dimensional and dull."
298,I guess I’ve just been living like this so long it’s hard to believe there are people out there who have never felt this way at all
299,"I'm clinically depressed, and have been on Wellbutrin for about 4 months now. It certainly evened me out a bit as I'm not as mopey, but when I get home I don't want to do anything but either sleep, or play video games. 

Now I'm not looking for any praise because this is something that every adult should do, but I've literally been stuck as too lazy to even take the trash out to the curb except for like once a month. By no means was it a neckbeard den, but it was pretty gross.

I swept, mopped, folded all of my and the wife's laundry, and finally took down the Christmas tree (I know it's May...) amongst other stuff. I'm going to go do some yard work now!

I'm sorry, I really didn't know where else to share because my family thinks I have it together as they never visit, and it would sound ridiculous if I told them how proud I was of something that should be a weekly routine.

I actually feel like I can invite someone over for game night or something, as a lot of my coworkers find it weird that I never want to do anything at my house.

E: wow, I did not anticipate the overwhelming support. thanks gals/guys for letting me know that I'm not alone. Also, obligatory thanks for the gold kind Sir/Ma'am

E2: ayy, y'all threw me in the 100k karma territory, thanks pals. *proceeds to get down voted to hell*"
300,"I was sorting out my documents on my laptop and found this file, I wrote it a couple of years ago and reading it now makes me realise how far I've come. Had counselling since then and so much exercise, socialising and growing. Made me feel a lot better about the current funk i've just worked through.

I haven't been taking my medication lately, not sure why I just haven't, I know it helps and I know one reason I've been feeling bad is because I haven't been. I just need to make more of an effort to help myself and keep moving from the person I was back in February 2014."
301,I’ve been having this feeling for months now and it’s been making me feel even more depressed
302,"I'll just keep it short and say: nowadays, I do bold things without regard to whatever the outcome of it may be.

 All I say is ""fuck it"" and wait for it to screw me up."
303,"That's all. That's whats getting me down. I have a few friends irl, but i feel lonely, i feel unloved."
304,I do. I know it's a lot easier than getting stuff done and I wouldn't be able to get half the stuff I want done done anyways.
305,I make a lot of mistakes and am very awkward so I end up thinking the words “kill yourself” dozens of times a day. It’s like a reflex at this point. I’m not actually going to kill myself but it’s like some subconscious desire bubbling up from deep down. I’m afraid I’ll start saying it out loud or something
306,Seriously- I can’t tell even if I’ve known them forever. Do they like me? Or are they just too nice to tell me how much they don’t. Today is a bad day and I’m just obsessing over everything.
307,"I don’t enjoy anything anymore. I dread waking up and I can’t wait to go home to sleep just so I don’t have to think anymore. I use to have more friends and go out all the time but now all I do is work, see my boyfriend, study and maybe see my friends once a week. My life is so meaningless I feel as if it isint going anywhere and I just feel so empty inside. I use to enjoy activities I use to be around everyone and be happy now whatever I do I can’t enjoy . I don’t know how to get out of this sometimes I can sit for hours just staring at a wall I am so dead inside"
308,"The past two weeks I have cooked almost daily instead of eating fast food, I’ve kept my house clean, showered regularly, and I’ve done all of my work for Grad school (even some of it way ahead of time). I usually don’t say I’m proud of myself but I think I need to say it today."
309,"That's all I want. I wanna go to a park, lay on the grass by the lake and look at the stars, alone. Life is so beautiful, just wish I wasn't apart or this society "
310,"I wish I still felt that full-body joy/euphoria like I did as a kid. Waking up on Christmas morning, making eye contact with a boy I had a crush on during class, playing video games with my dad and winning the level. Everything feels so dulled and flat now, it makes me wonder what the point is. I’m spending money to go on holiday to beautiful places and barely enjoying it. The closest I get to joy is when I’m shitfaced drunk. 

Antidepressants sorta help but I don’t want to be taking them forever, plus the side effects are crappy. I guess I will have to settle for experiencing that childlike wonder and joy through my son, watching him do things for the first time.

Edit: please stop suggesting drugs"
311,"You really have to be careful with what you say around coworkers, friends, and family. If you’re not always a ray of sunshine, you become the negative, depressed person who is no fun to be around. At the end of the day, no one really gives a shit about what you’re dealing with. If you’re not being positive and smiling, no matter the reason, they have a problem with you.

I wish there wasn’t a constant pressure to be happy and outgoing. It is exhausting to hear comments about your demeanor."
312,It's the same thing over and over. I'm always physically sick and emotionally drained and I've gone through a lot since childhood. I'm just tired and hope for future seems bleak.
313,"I'm sad most of the time, and when I'm not, I'm empty. I've put into motion plans that I think will make me happy again, but they'll take years, and I'm tired of waiting. How do I withstand my life until it's all better?"
314,"I can’t concentrate, I don’t focus, I miss the picture of concepts. Overall I’m just disengaged and demoralized. I live the same repetitive day over and over. Dropped out of school for the 4th time, can’t keep jobs, lose passion. I’m comically miserable. I don’t even feel like a real human anymore. I used to be articulate blah blah but nope. At this point I just drink a gallon of water and eat cereal that’s next to me until I have to move. No wonder my brain is rotting. Hell I can’t even get through reading paragraphs on Reddit. I generally don’t engage in anything bc it all feels like a chore in lots of regards. Same fights"
315,"The last few days I felt on top of the world, had boundless energy, felt my depression was completely cured. Was so happy, life was so beautiful, every thing was so beautiful. I was planning days out, chatting to people more than I ever do, making jokes, laughing. Felt a deep sense of calm and connection with the universe. 
Now I'm lying in bed tired and miserable because I painted my shed door and made a mess of it so I'm obviously a worthless human being. The idea of following through with any of those plans I made fills me with dread. 

I wish the happiness would actually last."
316,I often tell myself this and it really keeps me from opening up to others about how I feel when I'm upset.
317,
318,"I've never hugged anyone before...

I just want to know what the warmth of another person feels like...I'm so tired of being alone.

I'm so pathetic, I'm laying here trying to sleep and i just can't stop crying like a dumbass, hugging a blanket."
319,All life is is not killing yourself in the hope one day life becomes bearable. It never does. Please take me away somewhere else. Not dead so my parents do not suffer. Just make me not exist. Please.
320,"I think the world is beautiful. There are so many amazing things to see and do, and seemingly countless possibilities, too many for a single lifetime. I think people are amazing, and the shitty terrible people don't prevent me from appreciating the good ones (whom I consider to be the majority). To me, life is wonderful. Except I don't like *my* life. I wish I could be somebody different, somebody less mediocre, someone more attractive, more intelligent, more motivated, more adventurous, and more knowledgeable about what I'm looking for in life. I'm 21 and all I can think about is everything I have missed out on and will miss out on in life. I wish there was some sort of way to choose to be someone else. I don't want to stop playing, I just wish I could start a new game."
321,"**Update:  We are aware this person has been PM-ing everyone who's participated in this thread with claims that we are lying about their actions.  I hope it goes without saying that we're not.  One of the people who let us know what they're up to used the phrase ""persecution complex"" and the behaviour unfortunately does seem to be consistent with that.**

After warnings and explanations, they said they would cooperate then persisted in doing exactly what we told them was against the rules. After we resorted to banning the account, something we very rarely do here, they announced that they were going to escalate their rule-breaking behaviour.  The sort of person who claims to want to help, but ignores a community's rules while claiming to want to follow them is, in our regretful opinion, exactly the sort of person that our vulnerable OPs need to be protected from.  

If you received any PMs as follow-up to a comment you made on this post, please click ""report"" on all of them as this brings this person's behaviour to the attention of the reddit admins.  Thanks. 

***************************************************************************

We've had reports of PM-ing behaviour from a serial religious proselytiser whom we've had to take action against for persistently trying to ""save"" people in this sub.  Their favourite tactic appears to be encouraging people to join a church because it's a way to find a ""community"" - this is a notorious evangelical recruitment tactic.  Don't fall for it.

**Edit:  I should have worded that last sentence better.  We're not saying that all religion is ""notorious"" or anything.  We're saying that *this particular person* is being deceptive and manipulative, and misrepresenting themselves and their intentions in a way that's representative of the worst types of cultish ""religion"".  So our issue is fundamentally not with religion, but the misuse of it.**"
322,"This pattern has been repeating for over a decade for me. I don't still have any friends from then now. Hell, I barely have any friends left from 5 years ago.

I'm just so sick of it. I thought I'd broken this cycle, but it's rearing it's head again. I'm being told to just make new friends, but what happens a couple of years from now when they get sick of me too and I'm right back here, wallowing in my own feelings of abandonment, isolation, not belonging, etc. all over again?

It just reinforces for me that I don't belong on this planet, that as soon as somebody knows the real me, our relationship (whatever it's nature) is on borrowed time. That I'm just going to be flitting like a pariah between groups I never quite seem to fit into, spending the rest of my life pursuing validation wherever the search takes me next, until finally, almost mercifully, it ends. Just...why bother? If nobody can love me for the real me, and I can't for the life of me mould myself into a shape they can accept, what's the point?

Edit: thanks for the silver guys, I wasn't expecting this to be so well received."
323,"after depression there is no more need to live, its as if mental and physical death went out of sync"
324,"She was being badly bullied by people at her school for the past 6 months, and yesterday she did the unthinkable and took 40 paracetamols. Luckily she survived, but it's affecting everybody in the family awfully. I live in a different country to my family, and I feel so helpless that I can't be there and give them all a hug and tell them it'll be okay. Going to try and get the first flight I can to be with them.
She sent me a picture of her laying in the hospital bed, and she has teddy bear plasters on her skin. She's just a child. It destroys me that somebody so young, can feel so done with life. I suffer with depression too, and have attempted suicide in the past so I know what she's going through. I'm sorry. I just needed to offload of all this, as it feels like my head's going to explode with all the emotions going through my brain right now."
325,Dont remember the last time i was truly happy
326,
327,I never know what I need to be happy. How do I figure out what my actual social needs are?
328,"A little over two years ago, I’d been planning to kill myself before my 15th birthday. Today is my 17th and I’m actually happy I’m alive. I still have some very low days, but I feel so much better than I did back then. Things get better, even if it happens slowly."
329,"It's the state of not getting pleasure from otherwise pleasurable activities.

Or, as I read once in a website thread about anhedonia, ""*essentially, I gain nothing from my daily life; my world is cold and, as such, it makes life seem the same way. Everything I look at, everything I do, looks and feels the same.*"".

Is this something you guys identify with? Because I sure do. What's it like for you?"
330,I can't win.
331,
332,"Last week my long time therapist committed suicide and I don’t know how to cope. I feel so alone. This wasn’t just some therapist off the street, he was highly educated, well respected, and worked with a few institutions. Selfishly, I feel hurt and abandoned. Everyone is telling me to find a new therapist but not only does that feel like “a close friend died, get a new friend” but so much trust was broken. I don’t want to open up to a new therapist. The thought that keeps running through my mind is “if someone who dedicated his life to mental health and had so many resources couldn’t get better, what hope do I have?” And also, selfishly, “how could he?”  I know mental health is a beast and I know from his brief mentioning that he was fighting demons, but it feels so unfair. Like my symbol of recovery has been destroyed. Thanks for listening. "
333,"Yesterday a friend told me that. To be honest, when I am around other people I pretend to be happy as if nothing is wrong since I don't want to bother others with my issues. I don't really know why I am doing this."
334,"Hey Everybody.

I’m writing this to vent. 

About 5 years ago my girlfriend died. She died on the night of June 13, 2013 from a car accident. There was a drunk driver swaying back and forth in the road. She swerved to miss him and crashed into a tree in a ditch.

We met each other when we were 10 going on 11 years old back in 5th grade. Of course, for a while we were just close friends, but eventually it turned into more. We met each other randomly I would say. We just happened to be in the same class. From 5th to 7th grade, we hung out all the time (mainly during school). After 7th grade she moved a little ways away and started attending another school. We still hung out with each other every weekend though. I would say it was around this time we started actually dating each other. 

Fast forward to senior year of high school. At this point we had been dating for some time. Both of us applied to the same university so that we could go together after graduating. We wanted to go for film/ photography. We loved each other very much. We were honestly just right for each other. We rarely ever argued with each other or got annoyed with each other. 
We graduated from high school in May. Unfortunately, right after high school she had to move about a state away for family reasons, but then she was gonna be back soon for college. Senior year and after graduating we hung out quite a bit. When she left we would txt throughout the day and talk on the phone at night. 
On the night before June 13th we talked on the phone about random stuff for a good hour. She really hated living far away from me – especially right after graduating. On the 13th we didn’t txt each other all day because we were busy. Later in the day I waited until she was free so that we could talk on the phone. I txted her around 7 but she didn’t respond. I just assumed she was busy. A little after 8 I received a phone call from her mom. I was somewhat surprised she was calling me because although sometimes she would call it just seemed odd. I cannot forget or even describe the pain in her voice. It must’ve took her a few minutes to tell me what was even going on. Eventually she told me that my girlfriend had died. I remember initially freezing up, but I could feel tears running down my face. The pain, anxiety and guilt was massive. 

That night I could not sleep at all. The next night I slept maybe a few hours. My life took a sharp turn when she died. I was so much more lively and joyful – I just became dull and lifeless. I felt lifeless as well. This is kinda random, but I never grew my hair out growing up. It was always buzzed short, but when she died I kinda gave up and grew it out for 2 years. My life spiraled out of control for about two years. I became a nihilist. I lost joy in life.
I don’t wanna go down that rabbit hole though.

Fast forward to now. I’ve really came a long ways since then. I didn’t go to college right after high school. I couldn’t find the motivation to. After about two years I got myself together and attended college though. Right now in my life I’m almost about to graduate from college. Not in film/ photography, but I think she would be proud of me.

I wanted to write this because most people in my life have no idea that I lost someone so important. Losing her was like losing half of my being. 

Lately I’ve been thinking of her – wishing she was by my side as I graduate. I wish she was here.   
It feels good to write this though. 

For about three years I had no desire in pursuing another girlfriend, but lately I’ve felt the desire to do so. I hope someday I find someone I can love as much as I loved her.

Thanks for reading.        
"
335,
336,Maybe it's just a sad excuse for where I am in life but it just feels like my attributes weren't geared to succeed in this world. It's as if I fall hopelessly short in nearly every metric that makes someone a successful and happy person.
337,"Yeah, me right now."
338,"I’m not saying gun to my head thoughts. I mean like, driving down the road and once in a while my brain says “just turn into the opposite lane. It’ll look like an accident” but then I just shake it off. Or shaving my legs and think “just cut, bleed out, it’s so easy” but I never actually act on these things. They’ve just become a part of my life. I feel like my depression is almost personified in a weird cloud that follows me around with bad intentions that I have to constantly argue with. It’s exhausting. "
339,"Aka survivorship bias. We hear the stories of the people whose mental illness got better, but there’s little acknowledgement of those who have only gone downhill. I’m tired of hearing “It will get better, just look at what happened to me!” Because it hasn’t. Why should I continue suffering for the lofty hope that my depression will ease up? I call it as I see it. If my mental state has deteriorated, even after years of treatment, then I probably won’t end up as a survivor."
340,"Id push someone away even if I wanted them to stay, because I feel everyone is better off without me."
341,"I don't enjoy anything anymore. The hobbies I used to do just no longer interest me. The older I get, the less I enjoy talking to people. I havent talked to the people I used to call friends in several months. All I want is to go to sleep tonight and not wake up in the morming. So I can just be done pretending to be a happy, normal person. I don't want to kill myself because my parents and people would be sad, but I hate that the only thing I keep going for is so other people don't have to bury me. I wish I could get sick and die, or get hit by a car, or anything that would let me just be done."
342,
343,"If that doesn't prove that depression is one of the biggest illness to ever plague us, then I don't know what will. I really hope one day people would emphathise and know how it feels to live this way and how hard it is to open up and how small it feels to beg for a way out only to be ignored or shut down, that too by people whom you would give your life for. Fuck this shit, I hope I was born heartless and emotionless so I didn't care about these kind of people but I still love them even after they refused to help me. I hope I die a miserable death. It would only be fitting to the already cruel game someone is playing with me. 

If I cower and fail to kill myself and live long enough to maybe make something of myself, I promise to do everything in my power to eradicate or atleast help the people suffering from this. "
344,
345,"Depression is a fucking bitch.

EDIT: holy shit you guys are the most supportive bunch. I’ve been reading through every comment feeling more supported by each one. It breaks my heart that you’ve all experienced that same heavy pain that depression brings, but knowing I have people out there who truly get it makes me feel a little less alone. I fucking love you all, thanks for taking time to reach out."
346,"I try to keep my mental health issues to myself. I don't want to tell others because I feel like an attention whore, and I've been accused of that before. What about you?"
347,"I’ve forgotten what genuine and pure happiness actually feels like. I’ve forgotten what it’s like to actually have a passion for life. These last few months have been a blur, I can only really recall a few days in detail. I miss the old me, she had so much potential. She had so many friends, she could actually read a book without being overwhelmed, she looked healthy  and prettier. Now I can’t even move out of bed. I just lie there waiting for someone to text me, but it rarely happens now because either people hate me now or I’ve pushed them away. I don’t even have the energy to pull out my laptop and watch Netflix now. My housemates don’t even notice when I don’t leave my room for a week. Even my mother said this depression is making her life a misery. I used to be so full of life, but that seems like an eternity away, such a distant memory now. It feels like I have no one now and I have no energy to even move, let alone do anything slightly productive. Every single thing overwhelms me-the cat wouldn’t eat the food I gave him today because he’s so fussy and I just burst into tears. I’m so tired. I want out. Everything used to be so different.

EDIT: I never expected this post to blow up so much and I’m overwhelmed by the response rate and kind messages. I’m a bit too overwhelmed to reply just yet, but I will soon, know I’m appreciative of every single pm and comment. Thank you for making me feel less alone, this website is very special"
348,"I don't get it. I have so many things I could do right now - exercise, listen to music, watch a movie, anything - but I have no motivation. It's not that I want be lazy, no, it's that I have no inclination to do anything in particular and that I know I'll most likely feel disappointed if I DO force myself to do anything because it won't be fulfilling and all I'll be left with is a confirmed inability to enjoy things. I don't want to be sitting in my room alone doing nothing, but I'm too tired to be outside doing something. I'm just cycling between the same sites I check every couple minutes somehow expecting things to be different.

What does a person even do all day? I don't get it."
349,Every day I go to work barely doing anything and get home excited for the thought of being able to drink and watch movies in the dark in my room.  Does anyone else feel too drained from daily routines to ever break the cycle?
350,"I wish I wasn't born with this de habilitating disease. I find it hard just to wake up and do more than the bare minimum needed to survive. Anyone else wish they could just have the motivation to do things without thinking twice about it? For instance, I got promoted at work but it's so hard doing the homework needed for me to gain the knowledge to do this position. Other people in similar circumstances found it easy to just do the work but it's just a chore for me. And when I try to do it it's just brings so much psychological pain that it makes me feel physically ill so I go off and do leisurely things. Anyone have any tips to combat this?"
351,"Because the answer is always ""no"" but if I say ""no,"" they always ask me whats wrong. If you can see through my happy facade I'm nowhere near capable of telling you what's wrong without breaking down. If I am somehow capable of telling you, you won't understand and you will forever look at me through different eyes. You will always see my answer to your question written on my face..."
352,"People are only just starting to understand depression but it's usually depression that's making you stay in bed all the time or not eat... 


I always feel like people think I'm lazy or I even question whether I have depression, I exercise regularly, go to uni, eat well, cook a lot of fresh meals for myself, socialise and work... But I had to cut my hours because I had a breakdown. I find it hard to make it into uni, my attendance is awful. I'll flake on plans to socialise sometimes because of the lethargy and anxiety of leaving the house. I have days where I'm like a zombie, everything is boring to me and i have a hollow chest feeling all day, I feel heavy and I kind of feel like I'm trying to run through deep water.

But nobody really expects this from a depressed person, it seems like I get through life just fine because I do get through life but it's actually much harder than it seems.

Edit: didn't expect this to get the amount of attention it has. I'm reading every comment and I'm trying to reply to all of them. Thank you for responding, feels good to know this isn't as uncommon as I thought, hope other people find comfort in that too.

Edit 2: still reading every comment! Just wanted to share something that might be helpful. I downloaded an app called Moodnotes, cost about £3? You can log your mood each day (which is useful if you're trying to map your mood changes) and identify thinking traps etc. I'm not advertising or anything I don't even know if this is allowed but it has been massively helpful for me, it's nice to have a bit of balanced reflection each day."
353,"And I scored in the 'severe' range. This lead to the following exchange between my Doctors and I.

Doctor: This is a really high score.

Me: Thank you.

Thankfully, I saw the funny side it in it's awkwardness...and I hope you guys do too! Sometimes, the only way to cope with how terrible things are is to laugh...Stay strong, fam."
354,"It's ironic that depression is an illness in the first place, yet seems to be the only one that can be cured by willpower alone.

If anyone knows where I can get this ""Snap out of it"" medication I've heard is so effective, I would be so grateful if you let me know where I can buy it from."
355,"Funny how none of those people are making the same attempt for me.

Looking back on it, it's kind of funny. No one wants to be around a sad person, so you fake being happy to keep them in good spirits and not be alone. The charade works so well that no one would actually think you're suffering inside. A ridiculous catch-22, isn't it?

I was like a frowning clown with a smile painted on.

And now the years of caked on face paint has started to crack, revealing nothing but an empty expression underneath. Completely blank and hollow... It's as if my face has been wiped away. Withered to dust."
356,"He was 18. I grew up with him and he was like my little brother. He was gentle and sweet and loved animals and flowers and thrifted clothes. He was quiet and calm in a world that is loud and harsh. He killed himself.  He didn't let anyone see all the pain he was carrying every day. He was exhausted and he only saw one option and now I'm trying to pick up the pieces of myself. I am heartbroken and angry and devastated there is a crushing weight on my chest and I can't breathe. I feel too much while feeling too little.  I have struggled with depression and anxiety for years. But this. This is...overwhelming. It is excruciating. It is numbing. It is agonizing and yet it is impassive.  I feel everything and I feel nothing.   I don't want to die. But I don't know how to live.

I'm fighting every day. I'm pushing through for my family and friends who are also experiencing this loss and my cats who need me to feed them breakfast. Every day is a struggle right now. But I'm fighting. Keep fighting, friends."
357,This is truly how I feel when people ask me why I'm not texting/calling them back.
358,
359,"It's really weird. My friends in school have no idea about my depression and I like to keep it that way, so I always try my best to hide it and I smile and laugh and make jokes and sometimes, not very often, but still  my mood suddenly really gets a bit better but it will disappear immediately when I have a second to myself but it's just really weird. Maybe you can pretend so long that you can actually get happy. Sounds dumb but hey, trying to grasp every little straw here.

Edit: It's crazy reading how many people can relate. Thought I was being quite alone with that. Thanks for all of you sharing your thoughts. I guess at some point you are just so low down in that hole, that you seriously try anything to make it go away, even if it means, needing to force yourself through 3 hours fake laughing until for a moment you feel good, only for it to be taken away as soon as you have a moment alone to yourself and you would gladly collapse onto the floor and sleep for days"

361,
362,I lay in bed watching YouTube videos everyday. Sometimes I get up and watch YouTube videos at my desk. I have severe social anxiety and no friends. This is my life. 
363,"I'm currently sitting here laughing at myself because I'll literally put myself in situations where I'm destined to get sad by the outcome. 

I'm literally sitting here waiting for a text back from this guy as I refresh my ""Following"" activity on Instagram to see if he's liking anything so I can get mad/sad that I'm getting ignored. What is wrong with me ahahhahahahahhahaha"
364,"Because I can't watch a movie or tv show without procrastinating first, it's so annoying to waste so much time, yet I still do it. "
365,"I was doing great all summer. Wouldn't even say I was depressed just a few weeks ago. But with the clouds, coldness, late sunrises, and early sunsets, I can feel things starting to spiral. Particularly, I seem to have lost the ability to fall asleep at the right time or sleep through the night. My schedule is all shifted, and I'm basically just getting sleep in chunks at random times. My mood is reflecting my poor sleep.

I don't know if it's SAD or if the light changes are screwing with my circadian rhythm, but I don't like it.

I think depression for me tends to be a very physical affair. Body pain, muscle tension, sleep disturbances. It always seems like this stuff comes first. My mood issues are more insidious. I'm generally pretty rational and emotionally reserved, and don't tend to feel emotions super strongly in one way or another. So it sneaks up on me..a slow, creeping apathy and anhedonia. I tend to get pretty deep into it before I realize how bad things have gotten.

Think I'm going back on the Zoloft."
366,I’m just using resources undeservingly that should be reserved for more worthy people tbh.
367,Anyone else depressed by New Years.

369,"I can be alright for the majority of the day, but as soon as the sun starts to set, I immediately start feeling overwhelmed by my depression. I’ve also been getting suicidal thoughts A LOT here lately, without any external cause."
370,"I sometimes wonder how it would feel to function as a person, like how amazing it would feel to get a goodnights sleep and wake up in the morning feeling exited for the day. I mean is that even possible?"

372,
373,"I am so fucked up that I can't enjoy any game anymore. I just wanna die now
"
374,"Sometimes, I will literally procrastinate going to sleep so that I have more time before the next day. Because to me, the day doesn't end until I fall asleep. I don't even remember most of my dreams, if I have any in the first place"
375,"This is my 2nd time calling the hotline, i've attempted suicide an hour ago. This is supposed to be my final day, i was on my bathroom with a knife planning on stabbing myself so i can bleed to death.

I was in the bathroom for an hour, thinking about should i do it not?

I was supposed to do it but i thought ""What's the point of wanting end my pain if once i die i'll go to Hell and i'm gonna suffer there aswell."" So i didn't do it and went to my bed and cried.

I called the suicide Hotline, the call only lasted for 13 minutes because im scared of what will happen in the Hotline.

The Hotline did a help a little bit but everyday i feel worthless, ugly, nothing, and dumb, i have a Suicide Diary so if the day comes that i succeeded suicide people can read what I've been through.

Sorry for posting here i just wanna let it out.

EDIT: I appreciate all of the direct messages i've got. I didn't expect this to blow up. I'm sorry for bother y'all.

I believe in the Concept of ""Heaven&Hell"" i'm sorry if some of y'all got mad over this.

Yes, i'm a pussy... why would a person like go to reddit than get professional help, too broke to afford a visit. I'm only 16 so i can't really get that much money for a visit, my family never really believes  in depression.

I'm sorry for bothering all of you. I really do."
376,"I'd slowly let myself slip away, and reviled in filth for the better part of the year. I don't know why I chose to do this now, but I've never felt better. "
377,"I don't have any friends who want to spend time with me. I have on Friend but she doesn't care and I know that she doesn't. Im not in a relationship and never have been and probably never will be. My entire life has been watching other people make friends, get into relationships and be happy. I know I will be alone until I die. I haven't hung out with someone in months, maybe even a year. I try to ask if people wanna spend time with me and go somewhere but they either say no or flake on me. I feel like the least important person in this entire world. I can't even maintain a friendship, so hoping for a relationship is unrealistic. I'm so sad and so tired of crying about this every single night"
378,I’m beginning to wonder if I have a medical condition or if it’s just my depression. At some point in the day I’ll randomly just feel incredibly fatigued but it’ll usually pass in a few minutes. Almost as if my brain and body are shutting off.
379,"...sleep in so late.

...stay up so late. 

...never leave the house.

...never exercise.

...have no self control.

...eat so much. 



...am alone. "
380,"Hey everybody,

On monday my girlfriend of 2.25 years died in a motorcycle accident. She was only 18 years old.

I don't really know how to deal with the loss. I cannot speak to most of my friends. I cried a lot but now I just feel numb. I don't want to feel numb. I want to cry. I want to be sad.

I don't know how to handle it."
381,Life's a b*tch
382,"My roommates having his girl over for a romantic Saturday and I told him I could find someone to hang out with to give them some space. Two days ago I texted cousins, friends, and co workers and everyone said they were busy. or just plain didn't reply. I shouldn't take this personally, they are probably busy with stuff, but ever since I graduated its like I've done nothing with my life and feel like I'm not interesting enough to hang out with. I use to have a someone once who I did could always count on and hang out with, but they cut me out of their life completely and I just feel like like such a loser. "
383,I’m talking specifically about my immediate family here really. I’m sick of this “what’s wrong with you?” accusation. If you really want to know what’s wrong ask me to talk about it. Ask me if I’m okay. Ask me if there is anything you can do. Don’t just make the statement that you think I’m not doing well and then think that you’ve done your part in helping me. I’m sick of pretending to be fine because my not being fine makes you uncomfortable. I’m tired of feeling so guilty all the time because I’m not fine and my not being fine is so inconvenient for everyone else. Christmas coming up is so scary to me because I know they all want me to just be perfectly fine so that Christmas is great for everyone else but it’s going to be so suffocating for me to pretend and I’m absolutely terrified of it. 
384,"I had a dream where a met a great girl and we had an amazing time. But later the dream kinda started to break down and I realized I was dreaming. I was so sad that I’d have to leave her. While I was fading out of the dream she just held me and comforted me. I’ve never felt so cared for, and wasn’t even fucking real. I feel fucking pathetic."
385,Yup
386,"fucking ready to die,and deeply alone.


edit:wow. a lot of you feel the same. I say we abolish this holiday bs,make our lives a bit more tolerable. also,thanks for the silver I guess. that's a story to tell if I live long enough to."
387,"I don’t know if anyone will even read this, I just need to tell someone what is happening. here’s the story a little over a week ago I admitted my self into the hospital because I did not feel I could keep my self safe any longer. The next day brother was “looking for cough drops” at least that the excuse they used. And he looked in the box where I keep all of my SH tools in.  He then proceeded to go though my notebooks where he found some letters that were address to my family after I was dead but had never intended for anyone to read. I didn’t even want them to read them even if I had killed myself. He freaked out and showed them to my sister, who showed my dad. They then decided to search my entire room they went though every box and they took all the cloths out of my closet. They took everything out of my desk. Read though all of my notebooks. This happen last Wednesday and they didn’t tell me until Sunday. I saw my parents 3 Times between the time they found the notebooks and SH stuff. They said the his hospital told them to go though all of my stuff and they also told them not to tell me. I am really devastated that they read something so personal that I never wanted them to read. Now I don’t know what to do. All I’ve done since I found out is cry. I feel worse now then when I went into the hospital. Thanks for reading. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this. I just really need a place to rant. "
388,"I should look for a job but procrastination has taken a toll on me. My near future is uncertain and I feel unable to take responsible decisions for myself. I have to leave my flat in the end of the month. I will probably end up living at my parents again for a few months until I find something to do with my life. In November, it will be one year since I haven't been intimate with a guy and it makes me feel like I am loosing my femininity.

I don't know who I am, don't know what I want, barely know how to get the things I need."
389,"I'm stuck at home. I have nothing to do. I have no friends. I have no reason to go outside. All my family does is yell at me for the littlest things (especially my mother). My physical condition is worse than ever before. Every part of my body hurts. As soon as I start to break down or cry, I get yelled at even more. I feel like I'm isolated in a place that might as well be hell. I have nothing in my life that gives me even the tiniest bit of joy.

Edit: Thank you guys so much for all the kind words. And thank you to whoever gave this post gold. I feel comforted knowing that there are people out there that can relate to my struggles. It may seem hopeless now (it certainly does feel that way for me), but we'll get through this together. Love all of you!❤️"
390,"I have no hope, I see no future and can't push myself to do the most basic of acts (e.g. brushing my teeth). How do you break through that feeling of the uselessness of your deeds? How do you find the motivation to do the things you want/need to do?"
391,"I don’t have a life (haven’t in many many years,I’m only 25) I’m depressed and anixious all the time even when I’m watching YouTube vids. I just spend the day in zombie like state scrolling through Twitter or YouTube.

I’m just living through other people I’ve never meet. I’m just waiting for the latest news and drama. I think about suicide everyday. 

Can anyone relate ?"
392,"So um... I still haven't gotten over this. Money isn't the issue - I have accumulated some wealth from my family, her death, and my job. I can keep myself occupied in the morning. However, when its nap time its silent and lonely. No friends, family isn't available. 

Night is the worst. It's dark, silent, empty and I normally cry to sleep. It's easy to get out of bed if one of the kids are crying but if not it's hard. 


None of them will ever know her. She had loads of issues but I thought we could work them out. I thought she was better. 


I can't even read stories of death or suicide anymore it's too heartbreaking. I used to be able to read them but now I explode into tears and anger.   

The kids are 4 months, 1 year, and 1 year. All boys. 


There world view is that everything is great. They smile everyday. I'm on paid leave to recoup.


I'm so alone. If anyone at all could just talk to me please. Even to just say hi I just need someone to talk to. I no longer have anyone to talk to about my day. 

I'm sure no one will read this as it fades into the abyss of /r/depression but its worth a shot. 

EDIT: She is alive and at the hospital in stable condition."
393,"No, not the ""I recently lost my job, gf/bf, divorced, got cancer, I lost everything."" no, you're not the case.

It's not 'failure'. It's just losing something.

What I'm talking about is, never been able to hold onto constant job, maybe dated some but couldn't manage any relationship, invisible to friends, socially awkward, never was pretty, never achieved academic/career success, who never had anything much to lose in the first place,

Would you raise your hands? I wanna see how many are there besides me."
394,"I know nobody will read this...

I was staring at a glass of water mixed with a drug that in that dose has a near 100% chance of killing me. Stared at it for about an hour and even raised the glass up to my lips. But I never drank it. Something stopped me and I'm not sure what. 

But nothing's changed. I still want to die and everything is still shitty.

The only person I ever loved and cared about stopped being my friend when I opened up about my mental health. Just completely abandoned me. Everything else in my life has been shitty but that has really been a kick in the guts. I keep reaching out, hoping she'll reply to me and be friendly one day. But on the rare occasion she replies it's ""I don't want to deal with you"", ""find someone else"", etc. I fucking have nobody else. Everything I've tried has failed. Getting nowhere I'm therapy. 

I just want this to end so badly. Why can't she care about me? About my life? I just need a friend in her. Fuck my life so bad."
395,"It makes me feel safe, it makes me feel at home. It will never laugh at me, I will never feel insecure or exposed or watched while at bed. I can cry in my bed for hours on end and never will it say mean things to me or make me feel bad. I won't bother it and I won't disappoint or fail it, nor does it. I can sleep on it which is the best part of the day and it makes me feel cozy and warm.

my bed is my best friend and I love it to death"
396,"Yup... This is what one of my closest friends said to me when I opened up about my struggle with suicide and how the previous year I actually tried to kill myself after years of self-harm. I don’t think I have ever had someone invalidate my feelings so quickly. It just makes me laugh now when I hear some people’s ignorance and dismissive attitude when it comes to depression. Like damn lol. Anyway have you guys ever gotten a response like this? If so share it, I’m sure we could all use a chuckle or two. "
397,"Having to wake up and immediately being struck with this shock of *I have to do this all over again.* Have to go to school, college, university or even work, we're stuck in our imaginative sociable, unsociable life. There are no questions to our daily duties, as we're following the propaganda of what others expect us to be. 

Just imagine yourself not fitting into those sets of species. We all supposedly ""have a purpose"" to fill, but what if you don't fit that category? Where do we go from there?

In my situation, I personally think I am not fit for this world. I suffer with a major physical health issue and that constantly affects my mental health. Similarly, my emotional health is just as bad and it deteriorates my motivation to do anything. I have no one personal and close that can fully understand my situation. I lost the one person I loved deeply and now she is with someone else. There's nothing and no one left to live for.

I hate going to sleep at every night knowing I'll wake up again, doing the same thing over. I hate waking up every morning with this heavy chest pain. I hate life and I wish I could give up and end everything."
398,I was crying yesterday talking to my professors because I was having an awful day. And this stoner kid comes into the room because he didn’t realize we were having a conversation. He felt really bad and gave me a hug and left. He was definitely high but it made me feel slightly better.
399,It just isn't. And not because I say it isn't. It just isn't. I try to turn my goddamn thoughts around to be positive every goddamn second of every goddamn day and it just does not do anything to make me feel better. Coping strategies just calm me down. Smiling is so damn fake and uncomfortable. I don't even know. 
400,"I fucking hate it so much. People around me, just go through everything with so much energy and power and they’re still so happy and never exhausted.

I can’t remember the last time I was actually happy. I hate drinking because it makes me so fucking sad, but I love it because I can accept my sadness completely.

I don’t want to be lonely but I just want everyone to leave me alone so I can find the strength to kill myself. I hate it. I really hate it. It’s not fair, and fuck it. No one understands it, everyone asks me to open up and when I do they don’t know what to say.

I just wish everyone would leave and never have a good memory about me so I can kill myself.

EDIT:

Hey everyone, thank you so much for the support. I really didn’t expect so many of you to feel the same way. I appreciate all of you that are trying to help me out, I’ll try my best to reply to all the comments by tomorrow.

Thanks to you, I told my friend and she’s taking me to her therapist tomorrow. I’ll update again then.

I apologise for the spelling errors, I was drunk when I typed that out.

EDIT 2:

Friend seemed to have gone off the radar, didn’t get back to me with a time. So guess I’m stuck here then."
401,"First I killed the athlete. There wasn't much of him to begin with so it was easy. At the least he tried to give an effort to materialize during my college days. He even joined some after school group of friends to play with, that didn't really go anywhere.

Next I killed the gamer. He was easy to kill too because of the need, the corporate life taking much of my time didn't leave enough breathing room for him to keep up a fight. His antics still surface every now and then, making me wish for adventures and the blood pumping suspense or action of his previous endeavors. I just stuffed his mouth with career dreams, he didn't really struggle as he believed that to asphyxiate was actually reasonable.

Next I killed the party boy. This one, took a little bit more orchestration than the previous two. I had to kill his connections with his friends. I had to starve him of his former social saturation - and in a way that he won't easily recourse back. I made his friends believe he didn't need the contact, that he was happy. The party boy slowly lost his spirit, that's when I went for the jugular to end his pain.

Next I killed the musician. I almost didn't like killing him. He's the most recent one, and the most difficult one to get rid of. He has support your see. All the feelings and emotions closing through him everytime he hears, plays, or sings a song; gives him enough strength to push back. He's even made a solid group of friends that push and pull him to their graces, but an opening came in the guise of leaving the country - that tiny waver in his resolve let me sneak in a stab. It was easy enough from then on. 

I'm just afraid, that eventually, I might kill the writer too. And when I do, I don't really know what's left.

I'm actually surprised to realize that I've been hurting myself without physically doing so. I've lost more of myself in the past few months than I ever had in years. And I'm not making any more of me than what I already have.


PS. I wrote this to myself at a bad time about a year ago. And putting what I've been doing in words, has surprisingly help me curb and slowly regain ""myself"" throughout the past year. I still get spans of time where I feel like nothing, where I feel afraid of being nothing that I'd rather just lose my life. But remember all you've been through, things may not feel the best now but you are not worthless, you matter, there's a value to everything you've done and accomplished. So let's all hold on and hold tight :)


Edit: Thank you so much for giving my first gold kind stranger! And to everybody who's commenting I wish I had more time to reply to all of you, I'm surprised with the turnout and even more with how people feel the same and are/is going through ""losing"" parts of themselves. Let's all keep holding on to those and try our best not to lose more than we do. And for those who feel empty - it's never too late to find yourself, let's all fight for it, even if it starts with just getting up from your bed in the morning :)"
402,And then when you kill yourself they say they couldn’t have done anything to stop it. And they say they’re here for anyone who wants to talk. That lasts about a week. 
403,"Then that person tries to turn it 180° and talks about stuff that makes him sad

And when we take our lives people say ""why didnt they speak"" BECAUSE NO BODY IS EVER GOING TO LISTEN."
404,"I did it you guys. I'm so happy to have one small thing. I don't know how I'll reward myself since I have no money, but I'm definitely going go since this is an achievement and we need to reward ourselves when we do good. 

I  hope all of you who struggle with this know you aren't alone and aren't losers or horrible people or failures go being unable to donut on a daily basis. I know you're trying and I admire you for it. 

I love you all. Happy New Year! "
405,"Ever since the diagnosis, it’s hard to get out of bed, including showering, socialising, walking (I’m not going to even call it exercise), vacuuming, combing, etc. 

My Dad thinks that it’s laziness. He says getting out of bed & working out can lessen depression."
406,"Anyone else feel this? 

Can't work because of reasons raised by depression, depressed because I can't work.

Alone, no friends, no girls ever interested in me because of depression, depressed because I can't have those things.

Countless more"
407,"I have made so many fucking mistakes in my life that I wish I could take back. My life is in shambles and I wish I could just magically start over. My laziness is the death of me and I constantly fight demons in my head. It would be much better to just cease to exist at this point. That seems very peaceful. Life is so complicated and we carry so many burdens and problems day in and day out that living is exhausting. 

I used to be optimistic and said things like it will get better and in 10-20 years I'll be a happy grown adult with many loving friends and family around me but every passing year is getting worse and worse. Everytime I think I hit rock bottom my life gets even worse and pointless. I won't get into specifics because there are too many to list but I am starting to feel like a pathetic failure. I always wanted to be the best and be someone who others could be inspired by but I just ended up becoming a no life bum. I wish I would just die while sleeping sometimes. Waking up and sleeping knowing i have to wake up again the next day are the worst feelings in the world. Just leaving my bed is a fucking challenge at this point. I wish I didn't feel this way but I do. I'll end this incoherent rant here and get it out of my system. Even if one person reads this I'll he happy that I got this out there and could share my depression and rage which I kept bottled inside of me for so long. Keep kicking y'all hopefully we can all be happy one day."
408,I just want to cease to exist.
409,"It just seems so strange to me that most people don’t spend every waking moment hating themselves and thinking about death. 

Like while they’re waiting for the train what do they think about if not jumping on the tracks and ending it right there?
Or seeing a building and wondering if the impact of jumping from it will be enough to kill them?
Do they just look at a tree with strong branches and think “what a nice tree that is” instead of which branch would be best to hang myself from?

How is it possible that some people just don’t want to die? Not to mention so many people who go through painful and expensive treatments just to stay alive. It makes me feel so guilty for all the times I’ve wished to get cancer so I can die without having to do anything. I wish I could donate my physical health to someone who needs it so I can just let my sick brain shrivel up and die."
410,I think about killing myself fairly often but I don't think I could ever do it because it would devastate my family sometimes though especially on bad days I wish that I was just alone and no one was around to care so I could just do it 
411,"Hi guys,


I just wanted to let you all know I feel well enough to finally say goodbye to this sub. I have gotten a lot of support here, got some good advice and made a great friend. 

Whenever things go South again, I’ll know I have this safe space to return to.

Thank you all, and best of luck. You can do this. 

EDIT: I thought you guys might want to know what kind of things I tried and what worked. I took 3 different kinds of antidepressants, I'm now on Paroxetine and they seem to work. I've tried therapists and that's not my jam. I spent 3 days in a psych ward after my overdose and I hated it there (other patients loved it though). The thing that worked most for me was reading. I read Furiously Happy by Jenny Lawson 4 times, and that's the book that helped me most. Also: the Tao of Pooh (I'm not religious), and books about being introverted because it made me realize I'm not crazy. And sometimes, I would just lie on the couch and watch bad reality tv. I keep a bullet journal now, playing with colours and just writing down 1 or 2 things I have to do each day. Do the laundry (but not fold it) and cook dinner. Stuff like that. And talk. And if you think that you don't have anyone to talk to, we're here. And I'm here. PM me, I promise I'll reply."
412,"Even tho now I've seen a psychiatrist I still caught myself thinking ""why don't you just start being normal"". Like getting up on time and eating food and doing normal work isn't that hard why the hell can't I do it!!? I would hate myself forever if I'm jsut destroying my life because I'm living with a victim mindset."
413,
414,"It started when I was quite young. I remember being in a play park and seeing a girl get pushed on a swing by her father. I remember that gut wrenching feeling and tearing up. Today I was at work and saw a mother cuddling her daughter and she said ""you're squishing me"" and the mother replied ""that's because you are so squishable and i love you"" that shit made me need to close for five minutes."
415,"I've been a better state of mind this past year, but I think this is the day that I finally commit to it.

I'm not going back again. I made the changes that got me here after almost a decade of misery, and I can do it again if I end up back where I was.

I hope, if you read this and are suffering yourself, that you see this as evidence that no matter how long you've felt this way, recovery is always a possibility.

Much love x"
416,"Sorry if this is the wrong place. I don't think suicide watch is the proper place since I don't necessarily want to commit suicide. I just want to cease living.

I feel like no matter what I can't escape the demons I have. No matter how well I'm doing, my mind is always like ""the fuck? Get back in line."" No matter what, they'll always come back up and I'll be in my room alone at nearly 2 in the morning wishing for some disaster whose only fatality would be me.

Even then it doesn't even really matter if they're mad or not. I'd be dead.

**Edit to add: Thank you everyone for responding. You all truly helped calm me down. Now that I've gotten some sleep and kicked the shit out of some weights, I feel better.**

**That too, has passed. This too, shall pass.**

**If ANY of you need an ear, or a digital shoulder to digitally cry on, I'd love to be there for you. Shoot me a PM anytime.**"
417,It happens all the time.
418,"There's people who wake up every day and are excited for what's going to happen

There's people who have a healthy social life

There's people who have friends that care about them

There's people whose life isn't ran by anxiety

There's people who get texts and calls

There's people who don't eat alone

There's people who don't hate themselves

There's people who don't think about self harm

There's people who don't think about suicide

When they have health issues you can see it. No one denies that they have a broken leg or a concussion and no one looks down on them because of it.

Fuck"
419,"I'm constantly so angry that I have to do all these things i dont want to do just so i can continue living, which I'm not even interested in doing.  I'm angry I'm in a major that I hate and that the fields I was interested in make so little money that the field isnt even worth pursuing imo. I'm angry I'm going to have to work +8 hours a day 5 days a week in a job I dont like, I'm angry that i have to spend my mornings getting ready and driving to a job i won't like. Ill get shit benefits and 10 days vacation a year, so for the next 30 years I get to be miserable with the exception of 10 days out of the year when I can travel which is the only thing I'm interested in anymore. Probably what makes me the most angry is seeing all these talentless people on YouTube making millions for being morons while I have to go to school for 4 years to even make a livable wage and it pisses me off.  I get the whole ""life isnt fair"" thing but I can't stop being angry about it and everyday it gets worse."
420,Then the fact that I wasted all that time makes me feel guilty and sad. 
421,"It's most of what I do in my spare time. I dunno, it just gives me little views into lives I wish I could live instead of my own."
422,
423,
424,"I don’t know how it got like this. It seems alcohol is the only way I can distract myself from myself. If I just blurr my mind I’m able to blurr the bad thoughts.

Update: I feel like some people didn’t realize that I had already been drinking all night then went to buy more at 7am. Maybe that’s better than starting to drink at 7? Idk. I ended up only having a couple of the newly bought beers and went to sleep around 8am. Now I’m drinking water and watching game of thrones so I guess that’s good

Edit: can people stop telling me to try weed? I have tried and I don’t react well to it"
425,"I know this is the clearest sign of depression, but I love staying in my bed. Even when im not tired I feel tired. When I lie down and hide in the covers, I feel like I  can avoid the world and the anxieties that come with it. As a result I'm so unproductive as well and hate myself for it, and thats why Im in bed now.

&#x200B;

**Does anyone feel me?**"
426,"I want to help people on this subreddit with my experiences and pains but it's so hard for me to bring myself to hit post when all I feel is like my opinions and advice are useless,,
Edit: oh gosh ! I didn't expect to see so many responses on this. I really am truly sorry for everyone who feels like this. There are so many supportive people on this subreddit and reading what some of you guys wrote really made me feel wonderful. Thank you <3"
427,"Edit: Thank you to everyone who has responded with support, advice, or just simply sharing their story and how they relate. I'm not good at articulating my thoughts, so I haven't responded to anyone, but do know I read everything and appreciate it. "
428,"I’m lying in bed exhausted. Tried to do homework but I ran out of energy. I’ve been spending an hour or two in bed in the afternoon every day for well over a week now. I feel okay during the day but an hour or two after sundown I just find myself exhausted. I go to bed five or six hours early too wiped to stand, not tired enough to sleep. I get up an hour or two before bedtime to just fiddle my thumbs in the little to no time I have left.

This is weird for me. I used to be like this after a stressful work day but now it’s everyday even on otherwise good days. It makes me so furious that I can’t do anything. I have school, I want to paint and make little indie games but in the little time off I have to hone these skills, I’m stuck paralyzed. 

Fuck depression. Depression is a little bitch."
429,Just woke up and this was the first thing that came to my mind.
430,"I feel my depression gets worse when I think about how I live in a nice house, work a stable job, and am in great physical shape. Makes me feel like I have these things and shouldn't be depressed, but it ends up making me feel even worse. It's hard to explain"
431,After years of trying to bottle up and hide my depression I'm finally going to therapy to try and face it head on. Wish me luck. 
432,"whenever i tell someone about what has been going on with my life may it be friends or therapists, afterwards my thought always go to a rampage saying 

""thats not true, you are just lazy. you are not depressed. you are just manipulating them so that they can pity you."" 

i know its not true and that i have been very honest with them, but a part of me just think that. i am antagonizing my own self."
433,"I spent the last hour or two just switching between youtube, reddit and some other websites, spending no more than a couple of minutes on each. I couldn't barely finish a single video on youtube and I'd just keep refreshing the home screen for a bit, then checking reddit, then some other forums, then the game I'm afk in, then repeat again. It's too much effort for me to even finish a video from start to finish, let alone listening to music or even playing the game im afk in.

Anyone else just feel like doing nothing, feel like not wanting to live, when you are depressed?

  

Edit: Thank you for the reddit gold, even though its my first time getting it, I don't feel as appreciative as I should be considering the state that my mind is in, sorry"
434,"It was tense, I talked him through some dark stuff. He showed empathy like no other and I immediately felt like I already knew him and vice versa. 

At the end of the session he asked for my ID for administrative purposes. When he saw my date of birth and realized it was my birthday, he cracked up and through his chuckles he demanded, ""who the hell sets up an appointment on his birthday?!"" Of course, I couldn't care less if it was my birthday - I tend to forget my own age. However, his laugh was so genuine and from such a good heart, that *at last*, I recognized the ridiculousness and joined his laughter. 

It was the first time I felt 100% comfortable with another person in the same room. I couldn't have asked for a better present.

Edit: I can't thank you all enough for the wishes and positivity. I've been an active /r/depression dweller for the past few months and I've never been let down. Recovery or not, this community will always have a special place in my heart. 

*""The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life.""*

I know it's far fetched but it applies for me today."
435,"Edit: Holy shit! I never expected this would get so many responses. Thank you all so much for your kindness and support, let's keep fighting the good fight and make depression our bitch!
Special thanks to /u/chaz91w for the gold, you made my day!"
436,"I feel lazy, I feel pathetic, I barely finished a project due tomorrow and it is the worst thing I've done in years

I don't want to be like this anymore"
437,"EDIT: WOW... Just... WOW. I never expected this kind of response and I wanna thank you all a bit. After all, the only love someone gives me is from four beautiful girls that don't even exist (the main characters from RWBY). 

Again, I wanna thank you all and, as Ringo Starr would've said: ""I hope we get by with a little help from our friends""

Greetings from Spain (that's why my English is not very good)"
438,"Finally confided in my gf last night about my depression and she told her mom and everyone in my family and then she said I shouldn't live with her anymore. I got kicked out and she won't let me inside to get my things. We have a 6 month old daughter together.

I slept outside. It's 7 am now and I don't know what to do. I use her car to get around and now I don't have that. I also lost my job because she wouldn't let me go to work and I don't have friends or money for uber

She told me she did this to help me "
439,"I know this is just how society works--we have to work in order to benefit from the work of others...the exchange of labor. It seems like most people have just accepted this as reality. They get their work done and then enjoy the rest of their time and the things they get to do with the money they've earned working. But I can't seem to do that.

The idea of spending more than half my waking hours 5 days a week doing something I don't want to do and find stressful for someone else makes me feel so incredibly hopeless. It's only Saturday, and I'm already dreading entering a whole new workweek. This feeling gets much worse on Sundays. And then during the week, I come home from work and know I have to go back in a matter of hours, and the thought makes me miserable and basically ruins the time I don't have to be working. 

I feel like I spend 5 of my 7 days a week just wishing they were over. That's depressing to me. 

Anyone else feel this way? "
440,"All I want to do is sleep, but the thought of waking up in the morning and going through another day makes me want to break down and cry. Honestly, sometimes, I have just from the thought of another day of just going through the motions.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: Well shit. Did not expect to wake up to this post looking like this lol. Thanks for the silver, and thank you for all your comments. This made waking up less painful.

Edit 2: This thing keeps growing so I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who responds."
441,
442,"Just when I think I’m getting through my depression, it resurfaces and makes itself seem justifiable again. It makes it seem like depression is the final destination and I’m never going to get past it. 

I’m trying so hard. There’s not much more I can do. I could have the whole world and it still wouldn’t be ok. "
443,
444,"i cant even move my ass to toilet,it feels life a lot of work and im tired of seeing these bullshit advices in every post i read. all i want is sleeping every day and die without pain if possible."
445,"At a young age I was called mature by those older than me, due to my lack of showing emotions. I thought it was normal up until major life events would happen, whether positive or negative and in between, when I would not feel a single thing except for severe apathy."
446,I’m pretty much a mindless robot who just goes through the motions of living more so then doing shit
447,It makes it hard to even bother doing things. Like what is the point? Would anyone even miss me? 
448,"And in turn I get less sleep which makes my day even worse, great. Thanks depression."
449,"I feel like I am not the person I once was. I've gotten slow at making simple decisions. And oftentimes just confirm and reconfirm it with people around me to make sure I don't mess up.

Edit: Wow. This really blew up. Glad I'm not alone. Though this is bad in a sense, to see so many of you suffering like this. Depression is something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. Know that I'm with you..."
450,
451,"After 3/4 of a bottle of pinot grigio I decided to take my one woman pity party outside. I let the rain fall on my face. I let it soak my sweater. I walked down the middle of the street while the pavement shimmered in front of me. I stood by the water while black waves rolled towards my feet and the wind blew rain into my face. I held my arms out and let the wind blow across my body. I waked through the park. I got on a swing in the playground and let my legs take me as high as I could, like when I was a kid. I spun in the middle of the street while water got in my boots and soaked my socks. I fucking skipped down the middle of the street, in the rain, without a soul around.

And I know I will eventually fall asleep and tomorrow will crush me like every other day. But I really felt alive tonight for a little while you guys. 

Sorry for the theatrics, the pinot is still working its magic. Happy Tuesday.

Edit: Just wanted to say how moved I am by other people sharing their similar experience or saying that this post made them feel happy or comforted. As hard as it is to believe sometimes, we all deserve to feel that way. Today was as hard as any other day, but I know somewhere I have the capacity to feel better. We all do. "
452,"I’m the type of person who will really immerse myself in certain activities, hobbies, video games, television, etc. 

When I’m having an episode, as I currently am, I really hate the feeling of not being interested in anything.  I feel like I waste entire days just trying to find something I might enjoy doing, but it’s all been fruitless. 

It drives me crazy.  I just waste my entire weekend doing nothing of substance and go back to work on Monday."
453,I'm so fucking lonely. I can't do this anymore
454,I've been dealing with depression for a number of years now. I find masturbation as a temporary relief of that feeling. Does anyone else feel this way?
455,"All the symptoms are negative; short temper, self destructive tendencies, constant muscle pain, sporadic tears. Yet there's something deep in the abyss that beacons. There's an urge to indulge in all the negative feelings that come along with the disease, to be engulfed in it."
456,
457,"If something upsets you, bothers you, hurts you, makes you uncomfortable, then it matters. Just because so-and-so has problems that seem worse than yours, it doesn’t make your issues invalid. 

It kills me when someone opens up and talks about what going wrong in their life, and the person they’re talking to says *Well at least it isn’t any worse.* That makes me feel so little and like an annoying complainer because *obviously* my life isn’t actually *that bad*"
458,Depression is honestly on the verge of winning everyday but I'm still determined to try and beat it because I can't hurt those close to me like that. But it is getting harder and harder everyday I swear.
459,"I've always wanted to travel by myself but always been too scared (I'm 22F). Now that I'm on the verge of killing myself it's like why not. I don't care anymore. I'm not doing anything with my time (summer break) and I have money to burn (probably shouldn't burn through it but whatever, it wouldn't be used if I was dead). At least I will get to be away from this town and state with all these horrible memories. 

Edit: I'm traveling from Baton Rouge. I'll probably just go through Texas (namely Houston and San Antonio) for a week or 2. It's not the craziest trip but I think big enough for someone who's never traveled alone. Hopefully if it goes well I can maybe plan another trip somewhere else before school starts 

Edit 2: OMG so many comments and messages. I can't believe so many people care about me taking a little trip. I'm reading through all of them and I appreciate all the tips and offers. I will update y'all after I leave (might be like a week) and will upload pics and stuff afterwards. One thing this has made me realize is how lucky I am to have the ability right now to pack up and go wherever I want with very little consequence "
460,"Hi I’m 21M and before this Friday morning, I had never traveled before in my entire life without my parents. No friends sitting in my room being depressed and lonely about how I’m getting further and further behind in life (still do) but I’ve improved myself so much in these 3 days.

I’ve eaten out for the first time, (like at a resturant), I been going to places I didn’t thought I could find, I’ve managed to use the city’s train to travel, didn’t think I could do that. I’ve gotten thoughts to wanna take pics on the places here like the view, but I’ve gotten thoughts saying it will look dumb but I’ve done it every time anyway!

I’ve been open to meet up with ppl, but I haven’t found anyone, and I’ve been giggling the entire time being here cause it’s so pretty and I just feel so free!

I lived in my own hotel room! Like wow. To me it’s just wow. I been continually saying to myself on my room “wow, just wow. Wow!!!” And freaked out cause I can’t believe I’m just doing this without LITTLE TO ANY ANXIETY!? Like hello?!

I ordered room service to eat, even tho I had anxiety about it! Of what he would think of me cause I’m alone in my room. But after going outside for 3h i needed a “social break” to get back the energy to go out. (Self love right?)

Now I’m at my hotel room and tomorrow I just gotta eat breakfast and then I go home. (By train btw! I never traveled this far, traveled at all rather without my parents and I TRAVELED ALONE CAUSE I HAVE NO FRIENDS!)

The clock is currently 9pm, I could go out and go to a club, cause I never been to a club but that feels too intimidating for me at this time. I don’t wanna operate in the night time with not knowing the streets etc. (I’m taking care of myself)

This is more progress I’ve done in a friday-Sunday trip then I’ve done in 3 years sitting on my room and only operating in my small city.

I’m so proud of myself!

Feels lonely tho so I kinda wanna cry, I’m imaging how awesome this trip would’ve been (even more awesome) if I had a friend or ultimately a boyfriend with me! (I’m gay)

I’m so proud of myself. I wanna cry right now cause I’m going home tomorrow,I thought I would never say this, but I can’t wait to travel again! Preferably with someone this time!

I know this sounds cringe and I can’t believe Ive done this. I’m so confused why I don’t have panic attacks and stuff! But if I can do it, you can do it too. It really isn’t that scary, when u have small “missions” all the time to think about. I gotta go to x to eat and I gotta go see y and I gotta go check what train I’m taking for tomorrow, etc. these small missions keeping me  busy.

I know that when I get home tomorrow, it’s back to normal and misery waiting for me. But this was, I gonna say it SUPER FUN! I haven’t had this much fun in sooo many years!

I feel alive.

// Anton"
461,"No special occasion. I just had a tough day at work so I picked up a big bunch of tulips on the way home. Not the cheap ones either, but the lovely fresh perfectly blooming crisp and colorful kind. ""What's the big deal?"" you're probably thinking. The big deal is that there was a time in the not so distant past that the thought of ""treating myself"" to anything ""just because"" filled me with guilt, shame and self loathing. You don't deserve it. It's too good for you. You're not worth the time/effort/money. You are nothing and you have nothing to offer so you deserve nothing in return. 


So now I really appreciate any small act of kindness I afford myself. Yes, there are still days that I force myself to have a cold shower in the morning just because I hate it. I love cooking delicious food for other people, but I still sometimes eat instant noodles when I'm alone and having a bad day because it's a waste of time to cook just for me. But today I showed myself a little kindness. I acknowledged the fact that I work damn hard and I am great at my job. I have value and I am valued. Tulips are beautiful and so am I. I deserve to have beautiful things in my life because I am a badass bitch.


EDIT: Wow :) Thank you everybody. Honestly I didn't expect much of a response to this, I was just giving myself a little pat on the back for not being a dick to myself for once lol. I'm so happy it put a little smile on a few faces and even happier if it reminded even one of you wonderful people to be a little kinder to yourself. You're all awesome!!! And to the lovely stranger who gave me gold, thank you from the bottom of my heart for that. It was a nice surprise to wake up to this morning and put a little pep in my step today :)"
462,So you put on a mask of happiness and no one ever finds out and you sink even deeper.
463,"I feel so overwhelmingly sad. My whole life has crumbled so quickly. 

I’ve lost my job because I can’t focus at work. I can’t get a grip of my emotions and spend all day walking around like a zombie. 

My girlfriend has left me because she says she can’t be in a relationship with me anymore, I am absolutely in love with her and don’t know what I will do on my own. 

The cancer was diagnosed last week, stage 2. I have to go for surgery soon to establish if it’s moved on to stage 3. Strangely, this is the part that least upsets me. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel like I want to sleep, but I can’t. I want to be numb to all this. To make the pain stop but I can’t. All I do is cry constantly, I just don’t know what to do.


EDIT:  Oh my goodness. I went to sleep last night, finally. Woke up and saw the absolute outpour of messages on here. You guys are unbelievable. I can’t even begin to describe my gratitude that people who don’t know me would spend time sending such thoughtful messages. I love every single one of you. Thank you so much."
464,"I never felt like I was depressed, but recently I just have not been doing anything... My days look like this: Wake up, lay in bed, go to sleep, repeat process...

&#x200B;

I rarely have any motivation to do anything, and when I do it's something like browsing social media or going to the shower or getting some food - basically doing stuff that just helps me sustain.

&#x200B;

I have no goals, no passion, nothing that motivates me to get out of bed and do something.

&#x200B;

I know that many people in this subreddit feel the same way, but I just wanted to let it all out to the people that can relate"
465,"Im 32 male living In liverpool and so unbelievabley useless.
I sit at home all day have no friends.
I moved to a place where I don't know anyone.
I do nothing all day long apart from going to the gym. I only go to the gym because I'm a lazy fuck and give my self some pain and suffering for how useless I am. 
I'm unemployed because I have mental issues where I don't give a damm if I die or not and a risk from losing it everyday and wouldn't turn up to work if Im not feeling good.
I try to date but can only blag it for so long till my real self comes out that I'm nothing and not worth being in a relationship with. 
Im to much of a coward to commit suicide but hate living. The more I try to self improve the more I end up not caring about anything.
I don't trust people and people waste my time always. 
I tried to believe in God went to church quite a lot but feel like it's for delousonal people. And not one thing changed within myself. 
I'm just sitting here watching shit on Netflix wasting my time knowing I'm a waste of space and oxygen hoping I die of a heart attack.

33 years of depression since I was born. Everyone says your life will work out you'll be happy in the future. 
And time has been ticking on and passing nothing has changed.
Welcome to a life of depression.
And thanks to some incompetent waste of space of a man and women for not wrapping up before fornicating like animals."
466,"I don't mean just general regret for your life choices. I mean seriously annoyed with every thought you have, or the state of your living place, or even banal things like the way your clothes fit, or how your hair is hanging that day.

I don't know. I guess I'm just frustrated enough to bury my head in a pillow and give up on the day again."
467,
468,"They didn't care at all. I got a 30 minute lecture on how my life isn't difficult at all and ""what is so hard about your life that you are depressed and what to kill yourself?"".

When I struggled with an eating disorder, they didn't want to take me to counseling because ""you know they just put the parents under a microscope"".

I'm officially done. I don't care about these people any more. I told them the most vulnerable, deepest secret of mine and I so badly just wanted a hug and genuine help and all I got was a ""tough love talk"" about ""how I don't deserve to be depressed"". 

You are a peice of shit parent if you have done this to your kid. 

EDIT: Thank you all for the warm and understanding messages, it made me cry. To those who have parents like mine, I'm so sorry. Thank you so, so much. I woke up to so many messages, and I read every single one. "
469,That's what I realized today. 
470,"No control, no ambition, no motivation. Just nothing. I really wish I could muster up effort to start ANYTHING. Go to the doctor, talk to somebody, start a hobby, start learning something, but instead I do nothing and feel fucking powerless. If I do do something, I quit after one or two days.

My life fucking sucks."
471,
472,"I forget what I did yesterday unless it's worth remembering, ever since getting it my memory has seriously deteriorated.

Then again is there any wonder when our minds are going 100mph everyday and full of worry. There's hasn't been a time in 6 years where I haven't had a tonne of thoughts racing.

I'm always worrying about my future, or lack of it."
473,"Probably a rant, but what the fuck.

This last college semester was horrible on me, and I came out of it with depression and depression meds. I'm 19M in college right now. I thought it was pretty obvious, but I wanted to tell my friends about why I've been talking less and have been hermitting myself out a little. So the next time we're all together, I tell them that I have depression and that's why I'm taking meds and that's why I've gotten so quiet, ect. And... Barely any response. Basically just some ""oh, ok..."" Like really? But it get's better.


So the night after I tell them, I get a message from one of my ""friends"", whom I was going to room with next year. The message said, and I can quote, that they ""don't feel safe around a mentally dark person"" in their house. Ok, what? Even better, the convo goes on and says that my group of friends were talking... And they don't want to, in quotes again, ""Associate with a mentally dark person"" as a friend. Like what the fuck? It's been a week and they've lived up to it. Suddenly I'm not getting invited anywhere or anything. If I'm with my friends (I still try to hang out), I'll get heavily ignored. Like what the fuck, my depression has now gotten so much worse.


I want to ditch every single one of them, but I honestly don't have any other close friends outside of this group. I'm trying my best to find new friends, and if that happens, I 'll happily leave these people who consider depression sufferers ""dark and unstable and unsafe"". Just needed to rant

Edit: Also thank you for all the hug PMs they really do help ;-;

Edit 2: Wow this blew up, in my point of view anyways. I'm going to talk to them, and cut out whoever is still toxic about it. I'm going to try hard to make new friends. **I WILL MAKE A PART 2 TO THIS IN MAYBE A WEEK OR TWO, JUST TO UPDATE WHAT IS HAPPENING BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE GONE/ARE GOING THROUGH THIS AND I WANT TO HELP THEM IF I CAN WITH MY CURRENT STUGGLE**

Edit 3: REALLY THANK YOU FOR ALL THE HUG COMMENTS AND PMs ;-;"
474,"I sure as fuck do.

I don't know what to do at this point. Suicide sounds like a very convenient option at the moment, but I just don't know how I would go through with it.

I mean, what's the point of living if you have to spend a substantial part of your life battling inner demons? It's exhausting and I feel mentally crippled.

This has been going on for about a decade with no signs of any quantifiable progress or improvement.

What the fuck is the point?"
475,"Playing a WoW vanilla server trying to remember fun from a decade passed.

Staying up till 5am even though you know you have to work at noon.

Scrolling through your Facebook timeline and wondering who these people are.

Earing garbage from vending machines instead of proper food.

Saying you'll quit smoking as you buy another pack.

Wondering why you still have these problems at 30.

Crushing loneliness despite not actively seeking a relationship.

Never calling what little friends you have and wondering why they don't call you."
476,"Everyone around me seems to be doing better; like they’re happier, like they know something I don’t, or they’ve figured it out. I know everyone has their own problems, but everyone else overcomes theirs. I feel stuck; even when I make progress I feel slow, like I’m behind everyone. "
477,I would probably never commit suicide although Ive thought of it a lot. but i get suicidal about the littlest things.  somebody ignored my text? wish i was dead because no one cares about me. say something awkward ? wish i could jump off a bridge. its like my brain rationalizes suicide as normal option to the smallest problems. 
478,I think it feels like nobody in the world cares.
479,"I am 21 and have had mental health issues since 14. I can say at 14 it started while 16 it hit scary/severe status.

So with that age I’m around my family and friends because I can’t really get away from them. 


Over time it has become normal to them that I never want to do anything. And even though it’s true, it hurts. I know it’s abnormal and I can’t stop it. This “fog” has taken over my personality. I thought I’d be happy when people stopped asking me to do things, because I felt bad saying no.. but now I don’t get invited or included because people just “know”."
480,"I feel unmotivated, lonely and like I don't have a goal in life. Massive guilt has been pushing me down for two years now. I've thought about harming and killing myself multiple times. But lately, since I know I'm getting hospitalized, I feel like I don't deserve to go there. I've never actually harmed myself or attemted suicide and I feel like I'm taking away a spot in that hospital from someone, whos problems are way worse... I definately know that I have thoughts from time to time, which are extremely bad and sometimes make me suicidal, but they always go away at some point. It's so hard for me to know if I'm depressed. I always feel like I can't say I'm depressed, because there are probably others, who feel way worse and would laugh at my problems..."
481,Or sometimes I’ll be doing anything and i stop for a second and I’m say under my breath “fuck I hate my life dude.”
482,"I've stopped my friends from killing themselves a total of six times, and I'm 18. That's one of the main reasons I'm depressed. But I've told a few other depressed people about this and then they went like ""yeah, how about you try to kill yourself and start cutting, then you can come talk to me about your ""depression"" and ""hard life""""."
483,"I’ve been in therapy for years. In that I’ve been able to identify what has made me so depressed growing up and I try to deal with it. I spend a lot of time using coping methods and trying my best. For a depressed person I manage to excel in life.

Currently dealing with the sting of a breakup. Went on vacation to Asia and Ex broke NC before my trip to wish me well after what I gather was him finding out the grass isn’t greener.

I’m on a dream vacation with my older sister and her child while we visit her fiancé. A lot of my depression is triggered from a childhood of being parentified and also unappreciated and invalidated.

My sister spent my formative years teasing me for liking Asian culture and is now jet setting to my fantasy destination because of romantic love. Wasn’t enough that I liked something or it meant something to me for her to care or treat me right. Nope. Only a man would make her culturally open and respect me and my interests.

I was livid. I had been journaling, using positive self talk, etc but all I could think is “wow, people only care about me when I can offer them something.”

Creative services, language skill, advice, emotional support,child care...if there isn’t a task or skill I can do people rarely give a fuck about me.

I didn’t want to share this, and told her I needed a moment to collect myself and she kept bothering me until I cried at a shrine. I told her why I was upset and she kept telling me to put it aside because “we’re on vacation”. I turned on my data to call my mom, she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when I asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings.

I literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for 2 seconds and be a broken-hearted 20 something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple, but is trying her fucking best.

I didn’t need to spend more money on experiences.
I didn’t need to pretend I wasn’t upset.

I just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for 30 seconds and realize the only thing I want is a little goddamn empathy.

My family rarely thanks me for things. They don’t care unless I’m in crisis or isolating. I’ve learned to ask for what I need but it doesn’t matter because unless I have extreme reactions they can’t be bothered to hear me.

I am happy for my sister. I truly am. But jfc I am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup . Which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak.


Feelings don’t go away because you’re on vacation. Therapy taught me to deal with my shit, but unless I act in bad old ways my family doesn’t react.

I am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi. I’m part of this family too.

TL;DR depression reared it’s head on exotic vacation. Talking through issues got me yelled at...

Edit : Whoa...thanks for the gold. Didn’t really expect this but if you’re a depressed empathy like me
I know it’s hard and I know it’s lonely trying to do good while being profoundly depressed with people and their actions. Well get through it"
484,"I know that this is probably pathetic, but my depression got very bad and I didn't shower for months, now I'm back on track, going to try and keep going in every day now.

Sorry if I bothered you."
485,F*ck this... Not having a single true friend that genuinely cares really sucks...
486,Me and my friend where rating each other. I said I would handle it fine but he just when at my insecurities. Sometimes I think I’m overreacting but now that it’s out there I know. He said that my nose is to big and other things that made me really upset. He said I dressed to masculine for people to like. He said it wasn’t attractive. And he said I didn’t have a attractive personality. It hurts being the one person no one likes. It makes me really upset. And I wish I could take it better but I can’t. I even lost my clean streak of cutting. I feel so bad rn.
487,"Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not in ten years, but I have a burning feeling inside of me that my life will end on my own terms, when I am ready, and I don’t know how I feel about it. "
488,"I seriously want a change in my life. In terms of my social life, love life, everything... It's been 3 years I'm trying to find a change and yet I'm still the same. For 3 years I am the same shitty person, and still counting...

I want this to end."
489,"During a conversation with a friend I came to the realization that in my existence I don't feel like I'm trying to ""live life"". I I feel like I'm more trying to survive, just get through each day without collapsing mentally.  

Anyone else? 

Edit: thank you guys for the response. I'm sorry that people feel this way, but I take solace in the fact that I'm not alone."
490,
491,"Some days I'm pretty okay. Well, not really okay. It's just that there's enough time for me to anaesthetize myself on Netflix, video games, and other shit that doesn't do anything for me. It keeps my mind off of things. It keeps my mind off of trying to kill myself. It's pretty much exactly like taking painkillers. You know you're not okay, and you know the pain will come back no matter what, but what matters is that in that moment you're managing to not feel anything. And that in itself is a massive fucking success."
492,"Just like the title says I am 58 M.
I visit r/depression every day and start by clicking NEW. 
While reading the Posts I am always looking for those in my age bracket. Which is few and far between. My depression has its roots in 2001 but it really took hold during the financial collapse starting in 2008. When I first visited my Therapist (about 6 weeks ago) I typed a one page summary of my life from 2001 to current. It wasn't pretty. Went from a financially secure, entrepreneur, business owner, great father, decent husband, community volunteer, coach, etc. to......
Lost house, broke, in debt, IRS issues, Depressed mother F-er.
The issues were caused by me putting my head in the sand and NOT being proactive. Before, I ALWAYS took the INITIATIVE and CREATED opportunity. Slowly but surely I lost that ability and piece by piece my world came crumbling down. 
So, my story is different than a young person facing depression as a sophomore in college, or a 16 year old afraid to tell their parents about their depression. I care about what they write because I have 2 children (30, 25). And I hope they never experience what we are going through.
BUT, I still read EVERY new post, because I hope to find the Answer to my condition. 
Ok, time to go and look at the Pile of important things to do, and decide if I am going to take the INITIATIVE or go into my typical Depressive State.
Have a good day. "
493,"I don't feel sad. I don't feel much, actually, if anything."
494,"To my surprise, 3 of of the worst things that a grown man can experience has happened to me within the lapse of a week.

First, diagnosed with stomach cancer, then 2 days later, receive a phone call to inform me that my mom has passed away. Immediately I take the first flight back home to attend the funeral and help. Next day, after the funeral, I phone my wife for emotional support but instead I get the divorce talk. Unbelievable.

All of these things were completely unexpected. Right now I'm busy taking care of my mom's affairs and making sure my dad and brother are ok, but I can tell the next few months will be hard and sad.

I've never been depressed. I exercise regularly, eat right, go out, etc. But I don't think I will be the same after all this.



Edit: Thank you for the support everyone. I can't reply to every comment but be sure that your words mean a lot to me :)"
495,"Whatever I do or tell myself, I'm too lazy to accomplish anything. Even if it's something I really enjoy or look forward to, I just can't finish it. Time escapes me. And then my parents come and yell at me for being lazy, and then I zone out of even longer, and the cycle repeats.

Will I ever be an efficient, useful human? I think not. I asked myself this 3 years ago. I have not improved. I have not changed. How does one change, when I can't make myself /do/ anything?"
496,"when i’m around my friends i feel like i want to be in their conversation i want to laugh and smile at their jokes and contribute with my own stories but i just can’t.  like i physically couldn’t even if i tried i always end up just sitting there looking at them listening and not contributing even though i so desperately want to. 

idk sorry"

499,"I've had depression such a long time and I too feel like its too late to achieve anything meaningful with my life, or even become the most basic description of what most people would consider a moderately successful adult.   I'm 39 working this grocery store job that literally cannot advance anywhere and it barely covers the bills - but it does enough for me to live on my own which I'm grateful for - that is a success I guess.  But I'll be honest as well - the job is fucking miserable all day customer service orientated for snobby rich health-obsessed and trendy people. Being stuck at this job (its the best money I can find now) literally makes me want to kill myself when I leave a shift there.  I've got a manager right now who hates me and if you know what ""constructive discharge"" means that is what seems to be happening at work.

So anyway I recently got hurt at work and typing at and using a computer at home like this is about the only thing I've been able to do for about two weeks now to interact with anyone.  I can't drive very much while hurt like this so it really sucks like I can barely manage to make a trip to the store for some basic shit I need.  I have to get completely whacked on medication (which can be fun if you like it - but I don't like it when it is involuntary) to try to do anything physical around the house (like I HAD TO do this one thing or I'd get a fine) and even then it is just so painful and hard to move.  It will probably be this way another couple weeks but maybe I can heal faster, I don't know.  It seems like doctors where I am just will not prescribe pain medication anymore because there are too many people abusing it - so now I can't get some pain meds when I legit need them which just reminds me of another stupid aspect of our society failing.

I really don't see much point in my living at all when I am just going through the motions of life but I'm miserable.  I can get by financially (so far) but I don't want to just get by while I feel shitty and useless and unable to advance myself.  I hate it and there is no point to living this way - and theres several billion people living out this same lifestyle right now.  I don't know how so many people are ok with these pointless lives - I guess they are happy enough with that?  I am not ok with it at all.  Hurting my family is the only reason I am waiting or haven't already gone through with it.  We don't get along so great right now but I would still never want to hurt them in that way.

I gotta add, just to be honest and inclusive, that I have anxiety as bad as I have depression.  It's almost agoraphobic - like it is actually becoming a fear of leaving my house for the million things that could go wrong.  Being stuck here I am not happy but I guess I am safe.  I shouldn't have to live like this, no one should.

thanks"
500,"I’m in my mid twenties and I feel all I do is sit around and mope. This is supposed to be the golden age of people’s lives? I’ve accepted that I am different than other people who know
How to live fully. But what if this is the period that it gets as good as it will ever be. It feels like I took this time by my hands and flushed it into the toilet. Like i am responsible for my sadness and there’s nothing I seem to be able to do about it

504,I woke up today realizing how little of the past year I actually remember. I can remember bits and pieces but otherwise its just a blur.
505,"I felt like this very often lately. It's terrifies me. I keep telling myself that this is all just in my head, but is it true? Or is it merely a comforting thoungt I am desperately clinging to?

(Sorry for my terrible english.)"
506,"This happens to me everytime I read a really good book/manga, watch a really good tv show/anime/movie, or listen to an amazing song/track. I get so engrossed in it that once it ends, I remember my shitty boring life that isn't going anywhere, and I just begin to cry, simply because of how benign and mundane my life is. I just want to escape my life to go to that distant place that I read about, watch or listen to.

I wish everything existed."
507,"It seems like all of my close friends have moved on and made better friends. A big part of me doesn't blame them - they seem happy and for that I am glad. It's not like they haven't reached out before. They did, and I was guarded and made excuses not to hang out. Nobody knows how to talk to a friend who is deeply depressed. It must be difficult.

A few weeks ago, some of my coworker friends planned a night out for this weekend and invited me. I accepted and was looking forward to it, but a few days ago my one friend told me it had been moved to a later date due to scheduling conflicts. I saw tonight through her Instagram story, several of them ended up going out anyway as a group - it looks like they decided to go without me for whatever reason.

I'm not sure who I am if I'm such a terrible friend.  Not sure how to make it better."
508,"I’ve just realized that I haven’t been myself for awhile. I used to be really funny but I don’t make jokes anymore, I’m barely personable and I don’t talk to people unless they speak to me first. I’m such a fucking robot and I didn’t even realize it. So that’s fun.


Edit: Thanks for giving this post a lot of attention. It’s good to know I’m not alone"
509,"Lately I’ve been feeling so lonely and shitty that I’m not really interested in doing anything. I don’t want to be seen by people, so I dont leave my house. I spend a lot of time watching tv and if I’m not doing that I’m browsing around online aimlessly spending hours looking at nothing. I feel like I’m wasting my life but I don’t know how to change."
510,"Ever since I've had anxiety and depression it feels like my intelligence has just slipped away. I used to be sharp, in many ways I was above average even. Nowadays, my grades are failing, I have a hard time keeping up with conversation, and new ideas are difficult. Today, I tried to read a book and the words just felt so meaningless to me, like I just couldn't get the full idea. What has happened to me? Is this common with the other people on this subreddit? "
511,"Throughout the day I'll have moments, sometimes hours even, when things look up. I'll plan out ways to achieve all sorts of goals, get my life together, etc. - but all the while it just feels sort of...fake. Like I'm tricking myself. I'm always wondering, 'How long can I keep it up this time?'

When the time comes that I finally admit it's all pointless, that my life will be terrible no matter what I try to do, it always feels more like accepting reality than depression. 

This is always reasserting my belief that any sort of medication or therapy that actually had any sort of positive effect (none ever has) would just be a delusion. Like Cypher knowingly going back into the Matrix to be able to eat ""steak."" It just seems like a dishonest existence...and then I tell myself I'd rather be sad in the real world then happy living a delusion. 

I don't really know why I'm writing this here. I guess I'm just sick of talking to myself. This somehow seems a little better. That might be another delusion... "

513,"I keep on coming back to this in my mind but feel bad even thinking about it... does anyone else feel this way? 

Edit: Thank you for all the responses and thank you for making me feel like a less shitty human being haha. Love all of you, stay strong. "
514,"I mean someone faced such an awful life filled with hardship, and people are going to call them cowardly? In my opinion, that's seriously low. They don't know what they've been through. How are you going to call someone cowardly if you don't know their story, or have never felt the exact feelings they felt? Everyone processes pain differently. Even though it could be ""no big deal"" for you, it could be pain and anguish for someone else. There is no such thing as a coward, everyone is brave in one way or another.

Sorry for the vent/rant but I seriously hate life... but I'm too stubborn to give up. And I don't want to be called a coward because of the few times I've thought about ending things because they got too hard or stressful. I don't necessarily mean killing myself, but I've thought about giving up getting life together, getting in shape. Because depression is so hard to break out of. But I will always keep trying."
515,"I've only ever had one friend in my life. I've tried to make more, but people hate me. I've gone to community events, parties, hobby shops...etc to meet people. People just don't seem to click with me. I'm seen as odd, annoying, weird to name a few things I've been called. The only person I can call a friend is my wife. And I still do not understand how that came along. She just gave me a chance and looked at my oddities a little different.

Earlier this year, my wife discovered I have never had a birthday party. I never really had any friends to have a party, so I just never tried to have one. She said that was an injustice and I should have a party and invite friends from facebook.

She decided to throw me a party a few weeks ago. We planned it out for a month. Made all the decorations by hand, hand cooked all the snacks and food, even made our own party games to play. Sent out invitations to people on my facebook, her friends. We even got RSVPs back. It all seemed like my first birthday party would be fun. I was hopeful coming up on the day. 

Then the day of the party happened. We rushed to get it all finished before the party start and we were excited. The party start time came and 30 minutes later, no one was here. No big problem. Everyone always comes to a party late. 2 hours later, still no one came. I started to eat my snacks by myself. 

We got various excuses throughout the night. ""I got sick"", ""Stuff has come up"", ""car isn't starting"", ""No babysitters"", ""My boss just called me in"". 

My wife went to bed early. She was upset and mad. I told her it's ok. I am strong outwardly for her. I don't want her to feel bad no one likes me. But I am being eaten up alive. I am now in my 30s and I can't ever said I've had a true friend (other than my wife of course. I'm thankful she gave me a chance.). 

I don't know what is wrong with me or why I seem to be broken. I never should have had this party because ever since then, I just can't get it out of my head. Everyone time I would say outloud to my wife or family, they would tell me, ""Don't say that. Plenty of people are your friends. You're just being negative."" Now my wife truly sees what I mean. 

If I would have just told my wife no to the party, she wouldn't have been upset, and I'd still be ignoring the problem of me being friendless.

Edit: Everyone, thank you for all of the birthday wishes. Trying to get through replies and messages. Didn't expect this many messages. Thank you all again.

Edit 2: I see a lot of messages telling me to be thankful for my wife. I am very thankful for her. She is the best thing that has ever happened in my life and I'm the best that ever happened in hers. We have been through everything together even homelessness. That being said, I feel as if she isn't enough socially for me. We are 2 different people and even though we share a lot of interests, we do not share all of them. Sometimes, it is nice to have other friends to share your other interests with too. Example: She hates the show *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*. She hates it to a point that if I watch it, it should be on my PC with headphones so she doesn't need to hear it. I do it because I can understand it frustrates her. But I love the jokes so much and I see random stuff in the world and laugh because it reminds me of IASIP, but I have no one to share it with except the subreddit."
516,"My heart hurts, my head hurts, my bones hurt, my arms and my legs hurt, my eyes hurt.

Had a massive panic attack last night with my S.O next to me, not knowing that the fuck to do. I cried, said 'help me' multiple times. I can’t do this to him. He doesn’t deserve it.

Now I feel numb. I don’t care about anything. I don’t even mind going to work this afternoon, I don’t give a fuck about my coworkers, my friends. 

If it wasn’t for my parents and my S.O I would have ended it last night. 

The worst part? I thought I was done being miserable. My last months were happy and bright. I felt good. 

But after last night, I feel like nothing has changed and I‘m in the exact same spot again.
Those panic attacks scare the shit out of me.

517,"They originally belonged to my grandpa; I'm not a hunter but we used to go out target shooting and I was a pretty good marksman. When he died, he left me two of his old rifles. They've mostly sat locked in my closet ever since, worth a lot of money but unable to let go of them, partly out of sentimentality, but I'd come to realize that I also felt compelled to keep them around for more troubling reasons.

My depression has been lifelong and I've had varying degrees of success fighting it; recently things have been okay but I've had a nightmare of a time with intrusive thoughts. Impulses to do things I don't even want to do would pop in to my head at the worst times and I would fixate on the details of the aftermath until I would bring myself either to tears or to panic.

""What if I just went up there and did it? Would my wife be better off in the long run? Would the friends I haven't spoken to in years show up?""

This is shit I do not need running through my mind.

Two years ago I was feeling better. I was finally getting serious about art and photography again; I actually started selling prints and even had a little space in a local gallery for my work. Then the grey returned, and I started seeing less and less worth going out to see... Then the darkness came back and I became convinced that those things I used to see and enjoy were gone now and nothing good was on the horizon.

So, last week, I made a decision. Packed up the guns, all the ammo I had left, and drove to the sporting goods store.

I got $2200 cash for the pair of guns, and on the way home I stopped by Best Buy and bought myself a Fujifilm X-T3 for just around $2000.

Later that evening, the intrusive thoughts returned as I tried to think about dinner...

""What if I just went up there and--""

Then it cut off. The pressure was gone. Went up there and what? Grabbed the camera I've always wanted and started taking pictures?

I did. I cursed the cold, bundled up, grabbed my new gear, and lost myself in the woods, taking pictures of snowflakes and a family of deer that happened to wander though.

I've been shooting the camera for the last week and I can't put it down. I feel something; I'm really fucking good at this and I'm motivated to do it. My worst impulses have been stopped in their tracks and replaced by the desire to improve and surprise myself.

It's always going to be a struggle for me and I know that, but I feel free in a way that I never really expected.

518,"Information in class is difficult to obtain. As I’m usually having anxiety attacks and trying to talk myself down. If not that I’m just mindlessly taking notes. Not really focused on what my professor is saying. When I look at a question it makes my head hurt. Literally. I just want to put crumble the paper, shut my laptop screen, and lie down. As a matter of fact I don’t want to do anything but stay in my room. It has a full bathroom attached so my favorite thing to do is shower and watch Netflix. I do have a few friends so they randomly come in and out. But I have no desire to be sociable. I’m a shit friend. Now I’m rambling. Help

519,"When I was attending high school, i was top of my class with a dream of attending an ivy league university, particularly MIT. All my teachers were extremely proud of me. My parents were excited for my future in education. My peers thought highly of me. However, once the middle of my junior year came, i was faced with an overwhelming mental breakdown and fell into a depression.

I would spend sleepless nights doing schoolwork with already unstable mental health or i would do completely nothing and think. I eventually started to think about why i am doing this and realized that i dont like this traditional route im going on, nor will the results of it make me happy as i am already depressed doing the things i should like doing.

at that moment, my life lost its meaning. near the end of my junior year into senior, i stopped taking care of myself, developed insomnia (due to my obligation to try and keep up with my AP classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering), and slept in all my classes. 

my teachers, parents, and peers as a result started looking down at me, wondering why i became such a ""disappointment"" according to my principal when i wanted to lighten my workload. this put me in the deepest depression of my life as i felt i failed everyone and destined to be nothing. 

i would resort to cutting myself, drinking, taking old prescription pills, and withhold from eating as a way to ""punish"" myself. 

to make this short, i decided to make my main way of attaining happiness is music. that is my dream. everyone is still disappointed in me and it weighs heavy on me. i wish it could go away. 

this was more of a medium to vent instead of ask for help as i am not feeling well at the moment. thank you if u actually do read this."

522,"In my hardest moments of depression, the thought monster convinces me that I'm worthless but that other people still have worth. I also happen to be convinced that people are either lucky or unlucky and that there's really nothing we have any real control over. Because of this, I can even see the people who do the most atrocious things as forgivable. But with myself, nothing is good enough. Every decision I make seems to be not good enough, not worth enough to justify ongoing existence. 

Are there any things you do that work to remind yourself that thoughts do not necessarily equal truth?"
523,"Is anyone else “casually suicidal”? Like, you’re perfectly okay with the idea of dying and it’s just an average lingering thought part of your daily thought process. It’s more like thinking of ways to kill yourself rather than actually acting on them."
524,"I just want disappear but I am to scared of the pain of suicide and the meaning which comes with it. Suiciding also affects all the people who know you. Why did he do that? Did I treat him wrong. My parents would probably blame themselves and maybe get suicidal. 

Getting sick in a way that I couldn't be healed and die would be like an escape from this world. "
525,It's almost like you're Charlie from Flowers for Algernon. 
526,"I might sound like a total nutjob but hear me out. 

Most of the time I start daydreaming and fantasizing about actually having friends (as if) and an interesting life, like in a cartoon adventure or something. Sometimes I even make up scenarios in my head with real life people about things that could've happened. 

It's starting to become more and more frequent and I'm finding myself moving my lips to the conversations in my head. Then reality comes crashing down and it feels horrible when I realize my crazy fantasies will never happen. 

It's just so much better in my mind. Anyone else?"
527,"No I'm not staying in bed until 3pm because I think it's cool, funny or that I'm lazy. It's because I can't bring myself to get up.
I'm not wasting my life away on purpose or by choice. This isn't how I want things to be. "
528,"The TV in my house is really old and constantly needs repair. Recently it went out again and after procrastinating for days I finally called the technician. He told me that the like last time, this time too the circuit board was out. He changed it and gave me the bill. I was like the circuit board had a 1 year warranty and it had only been 8-10 months. He looked at me for a few moments and then handed me the last time's receipt. It way dated May, 2013. 
At that time it struck me; I had no clue of the past 5 years of my life. I was on the bed surviving and still doing the same. I just can't stop crying since he left. The worst part is these 5 years were just the peak years. I have been depressed since the past 11 years and I can't stop thinking how much have I lost in life. "
529,"I'm not sure if that makes sense, but I feel like I wake up each day just to wait to go to sleep at night.  I'm almost 27 and I just quit my job that I was overqualified for a couple of months ago because my psychiatrist and I came to the conclusion that the nature of the job was not good for my PTSD or OCD.  Now I wake up everyday at around 3PM because I can't sleep at night until around 4AM no matter how much or what medications I can take.  I also feel tremendously guilty when I get down because I remember all the people in the world with disabilities who would do anything to be in my predicament because it pales in comparison.  I also feel like outside of my parents I have none to talk to, not even necessarily about my struggles but just about everyday stuff.  I have friends but they never seem to want to do anything.  Nothing is interesting to me either, so I am bored out of my mind despite having things such as video games, books, tv, and laptop at my disposal.  I just want something to live for, and for life not to be so lonely anymore.."
530,"I'm too chickenshit to do it though. I'm too afraid of whatever potential afterlife awaits me, and I feel too guilty about how it would affect some of my family. 

I dunno...the idea of suicide used to scare the shit out of me, but it's become such a mundane, frequent thing that I've become numb and desensitized to it. I feel like it's no longer a threat since I would have done it by now if I'd really do it."
531,"When I was 18, someone at school had found a rough draft of my suicide note. I had planned on killing myself at the end of that week. The following events were an absolute  shit storm. 

My at the time girlfriend was devastated, my father was a wreck, my mother acted cold to me, and the whole school found out that their thoughts on “that crazy asshole” may have been justified. 

It’s been almost 3 years since then and I’ve seen therapists twice since. The part I hate the most about therapists is how you can’t have an honest conversation about suicide and wanting to die. When they ask “Do you have thoughts of suicide?” or “have you made plans of suicide?” I know I have to answer “No” because if I’m honest and say “Yes. This is my plan” then I’m going to get thrown back into the Psych ward for an indefinite amount of time for my “safety”

If I can’t be 100% honest with the person that’s supposed to help me, then how am I supposed to get any help. 

When I realized this I stopped seeing a therapist. Even after she promised me to keep coming in. 

At this point I feel like I have to fight this alone. "
532,"...Now I'm just a depressed guy in his twenties.

This sucks."
533,"When one of my friends asked me to explain how it feels, I was at a loss for words at first, but then I remembered that we both like video games and tried it like this. Thought I'd share it, maybe people can relate to it.

EDIT: Thank you all so much. It means a lot to me that it means a lot to you.

""Okay, imagine you're playing an RPG and you've been going through the most hellish dungeon ever. You've been unprepared, underleveled and barely survived. Then at the end you find one of the most awesome pieces of loot ever. It's called the cape of depression. It's completely OP. Putting it on would give you immunity to nearly everything the game can throw at you. Sure, there are some negative stats on it too, but those seem managable. You put it on.

And it's as awesome as you thought it would be. Nothing can harm you. It doesn't deflect or defend you against attacks, they simply pass through you. Nothing can touch you anymore. Swords, arrows, fireballs, doesn't matter. It's all the same to you, because you simply dont feel it anymore. For some time you feel like a god. You glide through the masses and it's exhilerating. Nobody can touch you. You're completely free.

But the cape has disadvantages. It doesn't just let attacks pass through you, but also any blessings, healing spells and potions. Sure, it's a bit inconvenient at first, but you'll manage. After all nobody can hurt you anymore, so you dont need these kind of things anymore. Actually you dont even miss them anymore. Since you put on the cape everything has felt the same anyway and those signs of affection dont have any practical purpose to you anymore, so why bother? 

So you continue with your quest, wrapped in the cape. But somehow it doesn't feel the same anymore. Nobody can hurt you anymore, so you walk right through your enemies, not bothering to fight. Nobody can heal or comfort you anymore, so you walk right through your allies too, not bothering to talk. It's just you and the cape. 

It's starting to get boring so you think about trying it without the cape, but as you try to take it off, you look down at yourself and realize that you're still carrying the very same injuries you got in the dungeon in which you found the cape. They never healed, but you never got any more either. Then you remember how difficult and dangerous it was without the cape. It's easy to remember too, after all you have those injuries to prove your point. You need the cape, so you decide to leave it on.

At some point things just happen around you without you taking notice anymore. Nothing can affect you, neither good or bad, so why bother? You're truly like a god now, but not in the grand, majestic kind of way. You are simply not in touch - both literally and metaphorically - with the normal people around you anymore. Maybe you're mildly confused and irritated by them. Why do they act like they do? What's the point?

You dont want to feel left out, like a freak, so you pretend to still be in touch with them. The cape helps you. It grants you a +10 to Acting and Deceiving when talking about yourself. And you need that buff, because if someone would come to close to you, touch you, they would see that they pass right through you and realize something is very, very wrong. You dont want that, so you stay away from others, which in turn makes you even more distant.

By the time you've realized that the cape was cursed, it's already too late. It has become a part of you. It's wrapped around you, around your true self. You are still somewhere inside, but around your true self is that vast cloak of nothing that keeps any feeling, no matter if good or bad out. You've worn the cape for so long that you have forgotten how it feels... to feel.

When you go to your allies and ask for help they dont see what the cape has done to you. They only see the old wounds and think you must be in pain. They cast their healing spells on you, but they pass right through you. However all they see is that those old wounds just wont heal, so they get frustrated and give up. It's just you and the cape.""

EDIT 2: Oh, and I while this was not in my original explanation, I feel that this should definately be in.

""...though some of the worst days are those when the cape randomly shifts your alignment to neutral evil. Suddenly you can feel again, but the cape allows you only one single feeling: Anger. You're angry at the cape for having so much power over you, you're angry at yourself for letting it happen and you're angry at your enemies and allies alike. You start to remember every single time insult and injury, from the small goblin that threw rocks at you all the way up to the lich sending wave after wave of mindless undead after you. You remember every single time your tank failed to protect you, every single healing spell cast just a second too late. Suddenly you're the fickle god again, looking down on the masses with a smile of disdain on your face. For a moment you're glad. You feel. And then the next day it's over. The cape has worked its curse again, only to leave you ashamed and guilty for being cruel to your allies and vindictive towards your enemies. But fear not, the cape is still there, wrapping you in nothing that protects you from nothing."""

535,"My memory is absolutely terrible now, to the point where I second guess myself about whether something really happened or not. I can still remember information as well as I normally did. But for the life of me I cannot clearly recall highly emotional interactions (normally negative). I can replay the situation once in the direct aftermath, but then I’ll keep questioning whether or not I imagined certain things. The only thing I can confidently say I remember is on a scale of 1-10 how shitty I felt during said situation. Little details slip away and I don’t trust my recollection of what actually happened. I always end up asking someone who was there if my recollection of the situation is correct and it almost always is, but I keep doubting my memory."

""please don't judge my writing"" 
  and he usually says
 ""it's alright""  
until the other day he went on to say. 
""You love to sign huh?"" 
And he went on to explain why they require people to sign and how he doesn't mind my terrible scribble. He even smiled and told me to have a good day. This little interaction made my day. As soon as I closed the door I told myself I did good. I held a conversation. It's the little things guys. Stop beating yourself up and focus on the things you've done successfully.

539,"She had a boyfriend so she had to decline but that's alright, at least she was upfront about it. Just wanted to share this small victory I had today."
540,"For quite a while now I've been pretty bummed out, and whenever I am just crossing the road or on the top of a building I just envy that somehow my death could be accidental. Or just wish that someone would kill me for no reason, I wouldn't say that I'm suicidal but I just don't want to be here anymore and it would be easier on my family if they thought it was an accident. Does anyone else feel this way?"
541,"About a year ago I realized my computer was running slower than usual-of course this took me a few weeks to realize since the decrease in performance was gradual. Once I realized, I opened the process tab and find this program ""depression.exe"" running, hogging a lot of my CPU. I'm fairly sure it's a virus, but the weirdest thing is that I haven’t been downloading anything that would contain a virus… and as far as I can tell it doesn't even have a function! Its only purpose is to hog CPU and make it more difficult to perform basic functions.

So anyway I try closing it, but nothing happens. I try again until Windows gives me the typical “depression.exe is not responding”. Obviously I click “close now” and wait a bit, but still nothing happens. I keep clicking everywhere and mashing buttons to end the program (PSA this is an awful idea… trying to do too much will only overload your computer) but my desktop only freezes. Oh well I say, I’ll just restart the computer and hope that tomorrow I’ll have more success in getting rid of the virus.

The next week or so I keep mashing buttons and hitting “end now”, but again this only overloads my computer and forces me to shut down for the day. Meanwhile the virus has been getting greedier and is taking up more and more of my CPU. Programs run slower, and I experience more stutters and lags in processing. Eventually I gave up trying to end depression.exe by conventional means, and sought antivirus software.

The software was a bit of a pain to install at first and costed a chunk of change, and unfortunately did no good. Sure, it was able to detect the virus (it turns out that it’s not so uncommon), but was useless in actually removing it. I had the same experiences with other antivirus software: not powerful enough, didn’t detect the problem, misidentified the virus… the list goes on. I still try to run antivirus software once a week just in case, but most of the time it just uses up even *more* CPU.

Some other users try to help, but it’s obvious they never had this malware. “Have you tried turning it on and off again?” “Sometimes when my computer is overloaded, I just need to delete a lot of processes for a bit”, or “It’ll run quickly again, you’ll see”. They don’t understand just how terrible depression.exe is.

It’s difficult because I rely on this computer for school, work, you name it. When I first had the virus it wasn’t too difficult to still carry out my responsibilities, but since the virus has grown, it’s become *much* more difficult. Some days the computer won’t even boot up. I miss assignments and fall behind, all because of this awful virus. I see others whose computers run just fine and wonder what I did to get this virus, and how my computer is just so different compared to theirs when we have the same model. 

Some days, I just want to scrap my computer. Even though I can’t afford a new one.

Edit: Thanks so much for the positive response guys. I've enjoyed reading all your responses, and hope you get a hug for every bad day you've had :)"
542,"I’m 23 years old. I’ve failed two years in a row of university, I’m back living with my parents, I’ve never had a job, I can’ drive, I’ve never had a partner, I’ve never fallen in love. I’ve never done so many things that people my age have done.

I know that really, that doesn’t matter, and that people will say I’ll get there in my own time.

So fuck it. 

I'm depressed. I'm dealing with it in my own way. 
I listen to music a lot. It takes me somewhere. I just wish some songs were longer. 
I take codeine to numb myself quite often. I get a prescription every now and then, as I have a condition which leaves me sore nearly all the time. Haha. Life's a cunt. 

I can't cry. I need to. I feel it nearly everyday. Being right on the brink of tears. But there's nothing there. 

I don't know how it's possible to feel so emotionally empty and numb but at the same time feel EVERYTHING. EVERY FUCKING THING. I can't breathe sometimes because of just how real it becomes. So many thoughts running through my head at once. Every little insignificant detail about the most pointless fucked up things. All at once. And yet if you were to look at me, you would see the most blank, dull empty stare. I'm nothing. And yet my mind tries to be everything haha. Such a broken piece of shit. 

I think about hurting myself and dying a lot. It used to scare me. I remember the first time I genuinely thought about killing myself. It scared me. And it kinda felt good that that's how I reacted. But that was ages ago. It's so common now, it's just part of what it is to be me.


Insignificant. 



***Hey, Thank you everyone for the response. ***
When I typed this out, I didn't expect it to get noticed and I almost didn't send it again haha. I just thought 'fuck it what have I got to lose'. But I'm glad I did, I cant believe how many of you are in exactly the same position as me. People who have commented or messaged me personally and said that I hit a personal note to them. It means a lot to me, I'm sorry if I don't get around to replying to everyone (you know how it is) but believe me that I appreciate this more than you know. 
In the future I will try to refrain from deleting my post instead of hitting send. Much love."

547,I just need to know im not alone. Im tired of seeing all these people better than me with more skills than I have because I wasted my life playing the video games and being on my phone. I mean right now while I cant concentrate in my calc class everyone else is taking notes and im just here on my phone because I cant understand the material and while everyone else has the capacity to study for hours on end for finals I cant focus for more than half an hour before I take a fifteen minute break. Tldr: dae feel like a loser and hate life
548,"Depression isn't an emotion. Depression has no cause. Too often is depression conflated with sadness or anxiety. I came out to my boss over my depression a while ago, and though he is one of the most kind and understanding people I know, he won't mention it. He sometimes asks me how my anxiety is doing.

Depression, when it is present, is more like the force of gravity. It is there, pulling down on you under all circumstances. Though I'm depressed I am often very happy- but still there is the unfeeling wet blanket of muddled confusion and writhing frustration seething under it all. Waiting.

A creeping numbness that insidiously degrades and diminishes every aspect of conscious life. A storm of screaming and hatred in dreams. A dull apathy in waking. A sinking stomach in the face of joy and a faithless lassitude in the face of hope. 

Depression isn't an emotion. Depression is a contradiction to every worthy aspect of life."
549,"I struggled for a fair while, probably years. The last two months or so I’ve felt great, however since yesterday I’ve just seemingly hit rock bottom again, can’t see any positivity in anything, can’t motivate myself to do basic things.

553,"She had cancer and was 27.. We've been together for 9 years and were going to marry in a couple of years.. We had lived for 2 years by now and everything was going perfectly.. maybe too much.. We were faithful, devoted to each other. She was my oxygen, I was hers. She was my first and truly love. I've never been with any other girl but her.. 
I feel kinda depressed and alone.. We had no many friends, so that just the two of us was enough for the most part of our lives.. I'll leave for our house next week, since I've been with my family so far.. I'm joining my old job again, but this time, no one will wait for me at home, my salary will be just for me, and all that mattered now it doesn't..  I've got no reasons to keep on living. Somebody tells me I should be glad to still be in this life. But as I see it, it's a curse, a damnation. She doesn't suffer anymore, as I am every second of my life now.. 
Just wanted to open up to you..."
554,"My parents suck. I was in foster care when I was a child. So were my siblings. Just some crazy ass shit we had to go through. I feel disturbed, sometimes.

It’s so weird to know that other kids are vibing in their rooms this holiday break. I’m just trying to get my parents to get their shit together."
555,"I have a ridiculous amount of drafts here talking about how I feel. I don’t know why. Maybe I just want the support of others who possibly feel the same or I’m embarrassed. I feel like I can’t go to my friends or family to talk about it. My family would immediately send me to a psych ward (I tried to OD a few years back and was locked up). My friends would call me dramatic. 

So, I guess this is my stepping stone to post here.

Edit: Wow it’s kind of relieving to see that everyone feels the same. But hey, let’s support each other?"
556,"Thanks, depression. I *knew* isolating myself and pushing everyone away was unhealthy and unhelpful, and yet I did it anyway because I felt I didn't have a choice. Now that I put myself in this position, even my small group of friends that ""understand what I'm dealing with"" or know what's going on have stopped inviting me to things entirely, and I know it's really not their fault, but it still hurts when I see the pictures or hear about it in passing. I know I can't expect people to still invite me to things when I always decline, especially now when the days that I feel up to being around other people are few and far between. The (anti)social aspect of depression is such a hard cycle to break out of. "
557,"During therapy yesterday, the topic of my past experiences with therapists came up. My therapist asked how many I'd seen in the past.

Me: ""8, 3 of them in the past few years.""

Her: ""Ohhh..you're a goner. Whenever I hear that from people - seen that many therapists - I feel like they're a goner."" 

Her: ...proceeds to sorta walk this back.... ""I'm pessimistic, but optimistic too."" 

It was kinda funny. I mean damn I agree with her, chances are I'm a fucking goner and there's no hope, but aren't you supposed to help be building my optimism and hope? If I wanted to hear that there's no hope for me, I'd just re-read literally any of my journal entries from the past 3-4 years. 

I could't help but laugh about it later though."
558,I feel so stupid. And so worthless. I feel like I try so hard and my trying is either unwanted or unappreciated. I feel like I burden everyone I meet just by being around them. I worry about all the wrong things never any of the right ones. Sometimes I just want to up and go and escape all of the chaos. And other times I feel on top of the world. Today I’m at the very bottom.

Honest to god I hate my life so much. I’m a 16 year boy.I try to make every negative thing positive but it doesn’t works. So much has happen to me in the last year. My parents and sister passed away in an accident last year, I don’t if I should feel bad since they’ve tortured me mentally and physically my whole life. I never though much of it. But once my uncle raped me at 6, and told me to shut up or he’ll kill me. When I came of age I found out the truth. I revealed it to. My parents, who tried to get me arrested for being mentally ill. Just because they wanted to save face. But what has happened happened . I escaped the morning after they found out and tortured me to shut up(same night they tried to get me arrested). I escaped and entered foster care when I was 13/14 .I’m in my last year in high school. I have my gcse and I can’t study with due to the time limit my carer has given me and it just doesn’t work because the house is far from my school so it takes long to travel. I travel for 4 hours(mostly walking)(it’s 7.4 miles, however I take multiple bus routes and walk for an hour).4 hours there and back. So that meant I had 8 hours to sleep or study.So I barely get any chance to revise. Especially since I know I’m smart (I got straight 7s ‘A’ in my mocks before this unfolded). So it’s so frustrating since I didn’t do too well in my last mock, due to my parents death a few days before my 2nd mocks started, now I’m struggling to stay in my high sets. Then there’s my social life. As I said it’s hard to do anything since I live far my original town (around an hour away). Side track- I used to be really overweight but due me being bullied as a kid and then my crush making fun of Me, motivated me to lose weight, age 13(85kg) to age 14(51kg) which I was proud off. But that routine got destroyed due to me moving into foster. I gained weight and now I’m age 15, 2 months away from 16. (65kg). And one thing that annoys me is that my aunty could’ve taken my. She had a high paying job, but she didn’t want to take care of ‘kid’ ( she’s married and has a child). She was also a social worker. However I forgot to mention. It was this women, this women who I confided in. Someone I though was my hope. She was the one that betrayed me and told my parents about my uncle raping me and me wanting to move out when I turn 18. She betrayed me and made it seems as though I fabricated this lie so I could move out. She promised me to wait till I turned 18 so I had a choice in my life. But nope she couldn’t wait. First of all. I wasn’t the only one raped. 2 other kids were also raped by him. They both told my aunty. But to save face. They threatened the other two. Because they’re still 11. They’re more likely to listen. I didn’t. Therefore the reason I was tortured. I hate her with all my life. My only hope turned into my biggest disappointment. (Police gave up due to the lack of testimony, whole family conspired against me) In addition to my social life. As I mention I was bullied my whole childhood. I was a fat kid who didn’t know how to socialise. Becuz my parents always fought or let their frustration out on me. Mentally or physically. And because I wasn’t ‘popular’ , my ‘best friend’ pretended not to know me in school and then supposedly wants to always hang out with me when ever there wasn’t school. I was still naive then. He betrayed me twice in high school. I ended our friendship 2 years ago after the 2nd time I trusted him and he betrayed me. A few weeks after that I met a new person who was a really good friend. That was when his cousin wasn’t around. His cousin lied framed me racist comment(weird even though we’re the same race, but still I didn’t even say it, I proved it a week later when he posted the wrong screenshot since we had beef showing he said it first and all I did was say the same thing back).and what my friend did was support him. That infuriated me since I knew he was supporting him and sat next thing.what makes it even worse was that it was all on his phone. I didn’t end my friendship with this person, but I did drift off from him. I then met a person who was a genuine nice person. We had a good couple of months. But his parents were strict so we couldn’t hang out much and we’ve kinda drifted off but he is still someone I would trust. I also met another genuine person. He was a new kid. And he is now my best friend, I think. It was weird because I never expected it to happen since he was popular I was just well a student.. even we’re close and talk quiet a bit. But I always feel uncomfortable with him, he never answers me with full sentences, doesn’t talk to me when we’re with out group of friends. But I do know he cares for me as a friend. But a lot of the time I think that if it was purely up to him and by date of chance that we say next to each other. Is that he never would’ve bothered speaking to me. In fact he’s probably the only one that would actually hang out with me in our group of friends. The thing our group of friends aren’t like friend but just nice people in my perspective.its like we’re friends only when the other person is here( if u get what I mean). It honestly is so fucked up me. I only have. What like a month to my gcse and all I. Am is depressed, down, I have never once been happy this year. Actually that was a life. The only thing that makes me happy is anime. I’ve developed an anime addiction ever since age 8. This was originally due to my parents fighting and arguing so I went upstairs to watch movies until I stumbled onto anime. The only good thing I can think of is that in 2 mo the I turn 16 which means I’ll be able to rent a flat thanks to my social workers. I’ll be in a new town (in a new school( I’ll be in college) and I’ll be able to start a fresh start. But still looking how my life is. It feels like I’m meant to have a hard life. It doesn’t help that I’m an atheist because that means I’m not able to rely on someone with 100% belief. I’ve never had a true true friend, my education is pretty much ruin, I’m literally on my own( my carer only cares about the money and my social worker can’t find any more placements). It’s so fucking frustrating. Honestly is it just that some people have a hard life. I’ve sacrificed so many hours of sleep that my heights been affected and that I’ve dozed of many time on the bus.i just can’t care anymore. All I want now is to become rich and take over the world. Without Any selfish desires, I just want to truly make this world better. Because it doesn’t look like anyone is gonna help me. I’ve tried, got hurt...many times and all for what.



Edit: half a year later into now January 2020(in my first year of college). My life has gone worse. I’m not in the mood to explain it. somehow, somehow it’s gone worse. Ive been diagnosed with metal health disorder. And no one understands me. They have bad view of me. And when I try to explain. They place their authority over me and won’t let me talk. Especially when I have facts. My social life hasn’t changed. My genuine friend with strict parents. Guess what happened. You would have never would’ve guessed🙄he spread rumours about my personal life and left me for another person. I’ve gained weight. I’m back to my weight before my weight loss. I’m now again 85kg. I didn’t get into the course I wanted in college becuz I was a grade behind. The works easy, but I can’t seems to concentrate. I zone out when the teacher scolds. Even though I really do want to listen. I do want to try. I’ve been having mental breakdowns pretty much everyday.I’ve been debating over the last few months to either take the drug and deep it’s effect. Even though my studies will fail more than it already has or overdose and commit suicide. I’m lost. I’m hopeless. I’ve got no one for me. I’m no one number one. I’m alone. I got literally nothing  to lose. And no one benefits from me being alive. It I’ve had enough of this bullshit life in this bullshit world. I have bad luck. There’s no desputing that. It is what it is. I’m committing the act on my birthday which is in June.. to a certain extent. This is kinda funny. Who would’ve though life could get this shitty at such a young age for kid born in a good area. Who would’ve though, not trying to sound pessimistic but I was genuinely kind and generous to all my friends and everyone I meet would suffer like this. The good guy gets nothing. Wow even I cringed when I said that. Whatever happens in June happens. If I do commit. I’d at least want someone to know my story. And if they meet someone like me. Please I beg with all my life, help him. The one thing I wish I had. Was someone who understood. Someone who didn’t listen because they had but they wanted to. Someone who wouldn’t try to tell me to look at the positive but actually help.  Someone who would’ve been my hero. Thank you for reading. This is KU/KW(before I changed my name and after initials) 14/6/2020✌️


Sorry I should’ve mentioned it. I’m in my second half on year 13. College.  I failed my GCSE. I didn’t get enough sleep. I ran away during one exam and all the others I couldn’t concentrate. I kept zoning out. I didn’t get into my a level classes. I haven’t made any new friends. My anxiety hasn’t lessened.in fact my social life has gone far worse.im finding it hard to keep up with all things pain I feel mentally."
563,"Does anyone else here find that long periods of isolation and depression makes their brains feel slower? Like holding an conversation requires more effort and problem solving is a lot more difficult? Even trying to formulate basic thoughts into text requires some hard thinking? I feel so foggy, detached and slow...."

566,"I hate thinking this way. I have a few friends, but I’ve never felt I was truly “in” the group.  We “hang out” together, but most of the conversations would be other people talking. Sometimes I wonder if they only take advantage of me because I would try my hardest not to lose them so I won’t be alone. 

Do they really enjoy being around me? Do they like me? I wonder...if I should find new people. But i don’t want to be alone.

Edit: waved hi to a friend. She completely ignored me. :/"
567,"""It gets better"" ""Stop thinking about it"" ""get over it"", etc.

Stop. Saying. That. 

I hate it as much as you do, I just want to be free from my mind. I am my worst enemy. I hate myself. I hate myself so fucking bad, you have no idea, and I hate my situation, I hate my life and I am trying to control my emotions... It's **NOT** easy. 

Did you ever get in your car and thought: Huh, maybe this time I will die? And feel almost disappointed you haven't finished in a car crash?  
Have you ever crossed the road and almost got hit by a car and was like: Damn, it was close!

Started to cut vegetables, and thought about hurting yourself?  
Hang yourself? Fall off a bridge? 

There are honestly thousands of ways I could have ended my life, for many horrible reasons, my own demons eating me, my own anxiety taking the best of me and my depression taking away my self worth.  I feel like shit and like I don't deserve a place here and my loved ones deserve better. I am lost. I am alone. I feel horribly... horribly numb. 

*I just want to die....*"
568,"I feel like after years of being depressed I've become worse at everything I try to do, I used to be able to grasp new concepts quite quickly but now everything is such a struggle for me. When I'm studying I'l forget everything and even when I'm focused on reading I almost feel like I'm just staring at a blank page. 

No matter what I do I can't seem to control my life and the more that time passes the more I feel like I'm getting dumber,slower and less interesting."
569,"I have very few friends, and even then I’m not really close to them. It’s VERY hard for me to make friends, and even harder to open up to them. I know they have plenty of other friends they’re much closer to and it wouldn’t really make much of a difference if I disappeared. Meanwhile, if they disappeared from my life, I would pretty much have no one. I just wish I really mattered to someone."
570,"No matter how good a conversation goes, I always end up so depressed and crying because I feel like everyone has a real deep hatred towards me. Especially if I did something ‘embarrassing’...

Any advice?"
571,"I attempted suicide about three years ago, and I'm still struggling to pay the hospital bills. Yesterday, I received a bill for a charge I didn't even know about.

It just doesn't make any sense. I wanted to be dead, but they forced me to stay alive, and now I have to pay them for it. Plus I have to pay for medications and therapy to keep me from getting to that point again. I feel like I'm literally just being kept alive for the purpose of paying bills. 

Why couldn't they let me just die?"

576,"I picture myself finally being able to believe that my friends and family care about me after seeing their concerned faces upon visits. 

I picture myself finally having a shift in perspective which makes me grateful for the life that I have.

I picture myself finally being able to do what I want- to stay in bed all day with no responsibilities.

I picture my ex visiting me, and us finally able to work it out because my damaged health made us realize how short life is.."
577,"I’m a therapist- but recently lost my job to my depression. It was a personal choice, but I felt that everyone I worked with wanted me to leave. I have severe issues with self-doubt. I feel like a fraud, like my MSEd is not legit, I didn’t deserve to graduate magna cum laude.

My family is financially supportive when I need them but not much else. My mom just tells me to take my meds (I do), or she offers me her meds. I told my sister earlier this year that I was feeling suicidal and she basically said, “between you and my cheating husband I’m going to go insane!”

My own husband is patient but not very supportive. I’ve been on the couch since Monday and he has been operating as normal, working, going into the office, never stopping to ask how I am. I know he wants me to return to “normal”. I worry he’ll give up on me.

I interviewed for another job last week and this week. It was an adoption counselor position, something I’ve always dreamt of. I did both interviews disguising my severely depressed state with smiles and makeup. I didn’t get the job. 

While still working, I found a therapist- in hopes of getting the support I needed to keep working and to be a good therapist myself. I made the mistake of telling her that I smoke weed sometimes. She then began questioning my work and my physical health. She also felt my main goal should be to get off meds (40 mg Prozac), as I was somehow “putting my health at risk”. Needless to say, I plummeting deeper into depression.

I spoke to my PCP and he prescribed me an antipsychotic. After two days, I was so sick I had to stop the new meds and see my doctor again. When I asked to try something different, he told me “pills aren’t going to make you happy.”

I guess I feel hopeless and alone. I have two little boys who are 3 and 6. My oldest son has severe special needs. I am able to take care of them, but I cannot get off the couch to do anything else. My body hurts, I can’t eat anything. My husband and kids went to breakfast and I stayed home to watch TV in my pajamas.

I feel a bit like I’m already dead, and that nobody cares enough about me to try and help me."
578,"Every fucking time... first I ignore it and just brush it off then it pops back in my head and I'm stuck on it for days it eats away at me.. I manifest the insult and let it define me. The most common one is a insult to my intelligence, every time it happens I'm fucked up for a week."
579,"So last night I got desperate and attempted suicide in the most stupid way. I took a bunch of pills with a lot of vodka. I would have chosen something more effective if I had thought about it more and I'm so mad at myself right now. I had the chance to die and I ruined it by saying goodbye to my friends who then proceeded to call the paramedics on me. I refused to go with them so then I got fucking detained and handcuffs. Cos the best way to deal with suicidal people is to fucking treat them like criminals 👍
Currently being guarded around the clock by police officers. Luckily they've all been really nice but this fucking sucks. I wish I'd been less stupid and less of a pussy. Pills are not worth it man. Probably fucked my liver up for life. 

Oh and only one person has visited me. A friend. None of my family have so much as messaged me to see if I'm okay. I'm also being told people are fucking angry at me for worrying them so much. How fucking dare they! I'm going through some of the worst shit in my life and they only care about their own feelings. I fucking hate how suicidal people are treated in this world.

Sorry for the rant, maybe someone here can relate.


Update:
I'm so overwhelmed by how lovely you have all been. I knew this community was amazing already but I've never made an actual post before (I'm using a alt account so when I shitpost people can't see all my private life to this extent) 
You are all awesome humans and I wish you all the best with your battle with this terrible illness.

So update on me if anyone is reading, I was moved to a secure unit 2 hours away from my home city to be assessed. They've deemed me fit to leave (NHS is very underfunded, I repeatedly told them I'm probably gonna attempt again but they still cleared me) but none of my family or friends are able to take me in yet (I needed a 'safe space')
I met the most lovely psychiatrist who arranged for me to stay in a B&B for the night in the lovely city of Salisbury  (For Americans/not Brits this is near to Stonehenge)
He was beyond amazing. It's not usual for people to get a B&B but I was so distressed at the thought of staying on that ward another night he arranged it all. He even drove me here, gave me a massive hug and told me I was lovely. Don't think I'll ever forget his kindness. 

I'm doing okay, of course I still have near constant suicidal thoughts but I've resolved to give life another try at least for the next few days. 


Thank you all for your comments and love <3

Lots of love,

580,"Like seriously mabye i would actually succed relatively in my studies, actually have a couple of friends i could hold on to, actually have something worth living for, if it was not for all the shit you get from staying inside and stacking up a shit ton of problems in your head.
At the same time i would be happy just having one good friend, living a mediocre life, aint nothing wrong with that it's just you keep hindering yourself with all the crap pentup in your head.
When i point this out i'm sure a lot of you guys/gals can sympathize with this difficulty when it comes to social interaction, it's so goddamn hard, unless i'm speaking to my family/a nice psychologist, i seriously can't keep the act together, i become this shell of a person not knowing what to do, and feel.
Not being able to feel like a real person and not knowing what kinda person you are yourself really hinders anything you do whether it's just in your head or whatever it's very real for us.
I think us in particular are the worlds most untapped resources, i hope everybody in the world will someday find a cure to this utter paralysing state, that is depression in combination with the extra package which comes for free (Yay free shit.)



Edit: It's always nice to know you are not alone, so for that i am grateful, but the fact that a lot of people feels similar/the same as me makes me really sad, it's a terrible state of being and i really wish the best for you guys out there, I really think someday this hurdle will become a walk in the park, and all of us will achieve that which we want :)."

582,"When I was four years old, my family was going to leave our country to live in the United States. They abandoned everything so my brother and I could live a good life. How am I supposed to tell the people to gave up everything, worked every single day, learned an entire language through just talking to others, and moved away from their loved ones for me to have a good life, that I don’t even want my life anymore? How am I supposed to tell them I don’t want to live the life they wanted for me anymore? How am I supposed to tell them that? It would break their heart. It would break everyone’s heart. 

I can’t do that to them."
583,"My depression won today, I couldn’t keep going as I was. I thought I could handle it, I really did. I was excited to study my major, but I couldn’t handle it. I started missing classes, forgetting to take proper care of myself. My room became a mess, and so did my grades.

My parents are coming down tomorrow to pack my things up and bring me home, they’re going to get me the help I need, going to keep me under their supervision. I feel guilty as hell for wasting so much money and time for college when I knew I could never handle it with the way things are. My heart feels like it’s in my throat, my head feels like it’s stuffed with cotton. 

I’m going to have to quit my job and find a new one once I get home. At least I’ll try to find something to keep me sociable and busy during the day. "
584,"Maybe it's just me, but I feel like the silence of every night is a reminder of how alone I feel. "
585,"Coming from an already broken heart:
Okay, so. Yesterday was prom. I care about the girl i went with so much and were kind of talking too. she knows i deal with anxiety depression insomnia and some other shit. anyway. everyone got up at prom and started dancing. this freaked me the fuck out dor whatever reason. i really really felt like i was going to break down so i went outside and walked around. turns out i didnt have the willpower to go back inside with everyone dancing and shit. i was out there for 3 hours by myself, and the occasional teacher coming out to check on me which made me feel even worse. eventually i went back in just because i felt so fucking bad for not dancing with her and i just hung out with her on the dance floor. eventually prom ended, she was happy , and i wasnt. We went to afterprom and were sitting down together on a bench. i end up getting so tired im literally falling asleep. she reaches over and puts her arm around my waist and kissed by head and like rubbed me in an affectionate way. i looked at her and i hugged her so hard because thats literally one of the nicest things anyone has ever done me and one of the happiest moments of my life. prom is over now and i havent heard from her since and its making me super sad, and i know i only have 2 more months with her bc of college... i really dont know why this makes me so upset but it seriously does

Edit: Holy fuck this blew up. For anyone asking, i did text her yesterday. She didnt open my text and still hasnt this morning. Kind of confused.

Update: She is super busy and i will hear back from her tonight."

587,"People have been nice to me and tried to help, but it doesn’t really work. Nothing really works, because I’m a bad fucked up person. It’s okay though... I won’t be here much longer. I’m just sort of confused on how to tell everyone and how it will feel to hang myself. I don’t know... I’m scared. But it’s much better than living. I will tell all my friends goodbye soon anyways... I think everyone will be able to get through it. It’s not that big of a deal when you really think about the bad person I am. I know I said it a million times but for real this time. I’m ready to do it. I’ve been broken a lot, but this time I can feel that it’s the last thing to break. Usually I’m open to compassion from others but not this time. I feel fixed on dying and I don’t want help. I don’t care anymore really. I don’t want to talk about it anymore or make any online friends anymore or anything fucking thing. I realized I have to do it. I knew for a while it was my destiny but I was too scared to do it. But it’s better to die now then suffer from suicidal thinking for 10-20 years and just feel even more worse things. If I can’t handle this what can I handle.... and to everyone that was mean to me or is just a piece of shit I hate them so much . I jsut have so much hate. I’d really like to hurt myself

Edit: I’m trying to reply to everyone but it’s a lot. Sorry if I don’t reply to you. I appreciate the comments though.

Edit(2): thanks a lot.... I feel better and I’m gonna try to keep on living thanks to you guys. I’d love to reply to everyone but it’s really hard. Just know I appreciate everyone who commented."

Unfortunately, none of the measures available to us as subreddit moderators has any effect on the ability to send PMs, but if you click ""report"" it will bring this behaviour to the attention of the reddit admins.

We'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that we think it's a very bad idea to trust anyone who tries to take ""supportive"" conversations to PM right away.  The only reasons we can think of why someone would do this are:

 * They know that whatever they're offering is against the rules, or in some other way won't stand up to scrutiny by the community.

 * They have a non-supportive and possibly sinister agenda, and they're preying on your because they think they can fool you when you're vulnerable.

**Edit:**  The above comments apply *only* to people offering/giving help and support.  We completely understand that there may be excellent reasons why a person *requesting* help may only want to discuss their issues privately.

This time I want to share some points about helping OPs who may be at risk for suicide.  

* Although we understand that depression and suicidality are distinct issues and we encourage people whose main issue is suicidal thoughts and feelings to post at /r/SuicideWatch, we don't feel that *any* kind of ""you should post there, not here"" message could conceivably be helpful to a person in great distress.  However, the information in [the SW sidebar](/r/SuicideWatch/about/sidebar) may be of help to anyone trying to support someone struggling with thoughts of suicide.  We link the two most important posts for helpers, the talking tips and risk assessment guide, from the sidebar here, but there's a lot more there.  

* Almost nobody posts about their suicidal thoughts on reddit because they don't know that hotlines exist.  Just providing a hotline number without finding out how the person might feel about that option can make the person feel invalidated.  Also, if it does make sense to suggest a hotline in a particular case, don't just assume a person's in the US. Imagine the how it would feel for a US redditor to be told ""just call 116 123, that'll work everywhere"" meaning everywhere in the European Union. There's a global directory in the /r/SuicideWatch sidebar, which is also linked here, and that's the best link to offer someone whose location you don't know.  

* Remember that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention that saves far more lives than it costs.  The situations where breaching someone's confidentiality is the best option are the outliers, like when someone is strangled by a safety harness. Plus, we almost never have enough risk assessment information to justify outing someone (which has to go through reddit's admins and their legal team) and subjecting them to a traumatic, invasive, involuntary intervention, which may discourage them from opening up about their feelings in future.  

* If you do feel that a post needs attention from the mod team for any reason, including high risk of harm, please take a few extra seconds to send us a modmail rather than clicking ""report"".  The linkage between reports and spam is hardcoded into reddit's DNA, so clicking ""report"" on a post increases the risk that the post will be snagged by the sitewide filter, which we have no control over.  

* Keep in mind that the most reliable way to de-escalate someone is to give them the experience of feeling understood.  A strong interpersonal connection is usually enough to reduce immediate risk of suicide. That's one of the many reasons why [this little empathy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw) is always linked from our sidebar. "

591,"Proof:

* The majority of food I eat daily is greens (mostly just spinach and kale)

* I have low-no sex drive (due to antidepressants)

592,"I feel like I wasted my youth. I get so nostalgic for high school and being that young again even though it was one of the roughest periods of my life.

596,"I was at my friends bday party at a bar when my father called me and told me that my mother laid to down to take a nap but never woke up. He was in bad shape when I got there so I decided to spend the night. I’m laying here hoping it’s just a nightmare but it’s really happening. She was my best friend and I don’t know how I’m going to go on.

"
597,"A lot of people here are depressed for very good reasons. I really don't have any. I'm pretty happy with my life set up (of course there are some things I'd change but on the whole it's good).

I just have this endogenous, chemical depression that's as bad as being in physical pain. I've been on so many meds in the past and they don't seem to work for me anymore. I run distance every single day and eat well.

Not asking for advice as such, just interested to hear if any of you guys are depressed even though your lives are good on paper. "
598,"I think about dying a lot. I think about the affect it would have and what would happen to the very few people who care about me. Sometimes I wish everything would stop and I could just be gone. 
But I’m terrified of death, I think it’s my anxiety taking over. 
I feel like I can’t even be suicidal correctly, which I guess isn’t a bad thing but it makes everything worse in my fucked up head making me feel like more of a failure."
599,"EDIT: *obligatory “wow this blew up* I found this subreddit in early hours of the morning, very anxious and upset about life in general. I don’t even know if I’m using it right haha. But I wanna say thank you to everyone who has sent kind words or even just a “damn me too” because it really helps knowing I’m not alone in my feelings.
I am currently seeing a therapist. He is great I’ve been going to him for a while, but unfortunately it’s a little hard for me to see him because he’s at my university’s counseling center and he’s pretty much always booked.
I so appreciate the advice on the student disabilities and medical leave. It’s definitely something I’m going to look into, and it wasn’t anything I was aware of until now, so thank you for mentioning it!
Someone suggested I wasn’t going to class just because. I feel like for clarification’s sake I should mention the reason I haven’t been is because I got very sick (I know these absences are excused) and that on top of getting used to new depression meds made it difficult. I live about 20 minutes away from campus, so it’s not like I can just run out of my dorm into my class haha.



I don’t know really know where else to go or how to format this so I guess I’ll just bullet point Why My Life Is Extra Shitty Right Now:

• College is kicking my ass right now. I haven’t been to class in like 3 weeks 1) what’s the point in going anymore I am so far behind by now and 2) I don’t even want to be in college right now and it’s taken me a year and a half to really realize I only went because I felt pressured to by peers and family. I want to drop out so badly, because I know I’m just not in the headspace to do it right now, but my family expects a lot out of me because I was “smart” in high school and I don’t want them all to hate me and also I will lose a pretty big scholarship if I quit going and shakdnhdiebd (not to mention NO ONE ELSE MY AGE is having any problems with this, just me which makes me feel 50x worse about the whole thing. like I have friends taking 18 hours this semester and I’m so behind and I’m only doing 13 haha what a LOSER amrite)

• I found out last week that I’m losing my job. I work retail and yeah I could find another job easy, but I was planning on being there for at least my undergrad and for some reason the store I work at being shut down threw a huge fucking wrench in my life plan. Not to mention it’s almost holiday season, I don’t want to be the newbie at a new job when it’s already gonna be hectic and I love the place I work at right now and I’m just sad in general it’s gonna be gone

• I started taking antidepressants about a month ago and sometimes I feel fine but mostly I’m just exhausted and can’t wake up until the late hours of the afternoon, which REALLY doesn’t help my whole not going to class thing
I’m just so stressed and have a constant headache I go to see my therapist later today which is good I guess but I just needed to put this out there to kind of clear my head

if anyone read this then thank you, I’ll take it as a sign of validation hahaha"
600,I have had this realization lately and it is very crap :(
601,"Anybody else do this? If so, why? And what the fuck?

You find yourself leading a life of self-imposed isolation, full of all kinds of self-hate, wishing desperately for some kind of validation, help, or support of some kind, wishing your friends (or really anyone) would actually reach out and give a shit...

...and then when someone does, and offers help or support of any kind, you get EXTREMELY uncomfortable with the human contact, and all the emotional aspects that come with it, to the point of getting really pissed off and hating that they even tried to feed you some obvious bullshit lie about you, “mattering,” or, “being worth something,” and wish people would just go away and leave you the fuck alone, thereby continuing the cycle of wanting someone to reach out but hating when they do? 

Seriously, what the fuck? I’ve noticed this pattern in myself and I can’t understand why. 

It feels like a combination of not deserving it and flat-out not knowing or even being able to begin to comprehend how to deal with actual genuine human emotion like that. It just freaks me out and makes me want to push away even harder, which logically I know makes it worse, but I can’t seem to break the cycle.

Anybody else ever felt or dealt with something like this? Because I’m at a loss here."
602,
603,"Everytime I see a human being that makes my heart stop I get really sad because I've convinced myself that I will never, never be able to have someone like that...if anyone at all."
604,
605,"This has been going on for about a year, I just don't see the point in going to sleep if I'm waking to another shitty day."
606,"You can still go to work/school, spend time with friends and family, and act like a totally normal person but feel completely dead inside. 

I'm in school and I make decent grades. My friends go to karaoke bars regularly to hang out and drink. It feels so weird singing emotionally charged songs while feeling absolutely nothing. Feels like living a lie."
607,
608,
609,"It's like, this inner demon wants to push me into his abyss and I'm holding with all the strenght I have but it's been hard to hold on for much longer. I hate this demon."
610,
611,"I've recently come to terms with my depression. Ive contemplated suicide, but i don't think I will ever do it. But every day, when I'm driving to school, I have this wish that someone would just blind side and kill me. I think that's just an excuse for my selfish desire to die. I think it would be better for my family. The memory of having a smart and happy child would be preserved. I would go without anyone knowing about my mental health issues. They would just say it was an unfortunate accident. Does anyone else think like this?"
612,"It feels like falling down a dark bottomless pit, wondering if your fall will ever end. And as you look back to where you fell from -the only way out- you  see it receding further and further into the distance, the light becoming dimmer and smaller while the hole in which you are falling becomes deeper, darker, and tighter. The light above you eventually disappears and leaves you in complete darkness. You can only look down, towards the end, hoping it will come soon."
613,"Inb4 comments like ""you're just acting helpless"" or ""what makes you different from everyone else?"" I'm not trying to act helpless or like I'm different. I just feel like I'm too weak. There a lot of things that upset me that... shouldn't. Like I'm terrified of confrontation, to the point where I start shaking. And I can't have arguments. Everything makes me exhausted, after 10 minutes of badminton I couldn't breathe, even getting excited or nervous gives me a headache. It's like I have no energy, I get so tired when doing schoolwork. And I'm very sensitive to what kind of advice I get, stuff like ""tough love"" gets me close to hyperventilating and I'll be upset for the rest of the day. I just don't know what to do, and I admit it, sometimes I just want to quit. I guess I just have to try harder, but often I feel like I'm too weak and sensitive and I won't make it in the world, and that things would be better if I stopped existing. "
614,I hope that I see you again one day.
615,"I'm an atheist and I just don't think there's any reason to have to go through such a waste of time, breathing on this planet for another 50-60 more years, if it just means I'll end up in the same place regardless of if I did something with myself or not.

I'm currently not studying, and I'm looking for a job. I went to a job/recruitment agency this morning, and they asked me a bunch of stuff that I was unable to give a proper answer to.

---

> ""So what's your dream job? :)""

\*shrug\* er... I don't have one.

> ""Well, if you had to pick a job what would it be?""

I really don't know... I guess one where I don't have to talk to people.

> ""It says here you were recently studying. Can I ask what exactly you studied?""

I just graduated in Social Sciences.

> ""Oh, that's great! We can help you get a job related to that. :)""

Er... I don't really have any interest in the field.

> ""Then if I may ask... why did you study Social Sciences?""

\*shrug\* Old-fashioned parents expected me to go to university after school.

> ""Okay, moving on... what are your long-term or short-term goals?""

Er... I don't have any...

---

I just started tearing up half-way into answering the questions, thinking ""something's seriously wrong with me"" that I don't have any goals or dreams. I've never been ambitious my whole life. Even as a kid, when you're supposedly full of wonder and imagination, I never really had a ""I wanna be a rockstar/princess/astronaut!"" moment.

It was always just ""I have to go to school cos I have to"", ""I have to study hard cos I have to"", ""I have to get good grades cos I have to"". And now that I'm out in the world, I still haven't figured out what the fuck's the point of anything."
616,"Every time a new problem comes up, no matter how big or small, I sometimes can't help but think, ""this is such a pain. I'd rather be dead.""

For example, here recently I caused a minor car accident, and afterwards all I could think was 'How can I kill myself?' because of the guilt and all my other faults. It almost scared me at how viable it seems as a solution. No more suffering, no more being useless, no more stupid mistakes..."
617,"Those with no school or work. 

If you browse Reddit 10 hours a day basically."
618,"So many people don't understand that sometimes, someone just wants them to understand what they're going through. To be comforted emotionally instead of given practical advice. In moments of desperation I used to say stuff like: I'm a piece of shit,I deserve to die. I don't need someone telling me I'm wrong, or what next steps I should take to feel better like exercise or eat healthy. I need someone to just say: I'm sorry you feel that way, that sucks. That's all I need. Someone to acknowledge my feelings. Trying to fix an emotional problem practically is like someone trying to fix a broken leg by talking."
619,"Maybe being an introvert it is just a draining affect? I dunno. It stinks when depression smacks you in the face after a while of feeling ok or even ""good""."
620,"Don't misunderstand this title, please. I am by no means saying depression is any kind of privilege - suggesting you can use 'the depression card' or whatnot. My point is that I feel my problems are irrelevant because I know there are a lot of people out there who suffer worse than me. I feel I am not in a position to complain. Yet, I don't feel content. I feel more apathy than much else and I don't know if that is depression and I am too stubborn to seek help for a diagnosis. Some part of me believes I can solve this on my own, but another part asks, ""and how long will that take, considering your less than stellar situation, will and mindset?""

Oh, and then there's the part which definitely thinks I shouldn't waste my time writing this, which in turn may waste your time by reading this. I am just confused and a little tired. I seek no sympathy from you guys, but maybe someone can relate. I wish you all a good day."
621,"You know, the one where you hit “rock bottom” and you have a mental breakdown, talk to someone, and then suddenly feel motivated to do something about your shit self.. until you eventually feel awful again. Rinse repeat. 

It’s very tiring. "
622,
623,"I'm at the point where I don't really want anything in life, even happiness. I know logically I could probably get better if I put my mind to it, but that thought just doesn't appeal to me anymore. It sounds weird putting it out in writing, but I was wondering if anyone else can relate to this. 

Thanks for reading, I hope you have a nice day."
624,
625,
626,"Yes, literally 0. I kno we like to say we are lonely here, but actually most people here actually have someone to talk to, even if it's online. 

That being said I just havr to say that I am trying to deal with it and as embarrassing as it may sound I often talk to myself aloud just to hear someone speak (even if I hate my voice and I find it grating). I am mostly okay with it...I think. Sometimes it gets really bad, but I try to occupy my mind with video games anf music so I don't think about killing myself.

Edit: I want to thank everyone for replying to this, I had no idea it would blow up so much. I was very in my feelings when I made this post and on the verge of actually killing myself. I went to sleep and now I am feeling a little better. 

I promise I will take time to read all the replies and respond to everyone. I also want to thank everyone who sent me a private message, I will reply to those too, but at the moment I am just feeling overwhelmed cause I didint expect people to actually relate to this or reply. I know it sounds cheesy, but I just wish I could hug all of you."
627,"sometimes it hits me at 2:49 in the morning when i catch myself in the mirror on the way from kitchen to my room, sometimes in 4pm when i realize how fucking alone i am and wasting the summer doing nothing

i hate myself when i see my parents with that disappointed look on their faces while talking to me, it's like i feel bad for myself thru them lol but then i remember that i basically have no more friends left, idk if having a childhood friend that is also a junkie who i smoke weed with twice a month when he has no one else to call counts as friend, no job except working a part time job once a year, i worked a 2nd one in construction until just recently, but was fired after 10 days because i was ""not needed anymore"", no girlfriend, that makes my mom so sad sometimes because she wants grandchildren so badly

where i'm from if you're in your 20s and still living with your parents and you're not having a decent explanation for it you are instantly a failure and ppl look at you weird because roughly 90% of ppl i know are either in college, or having a job and a decent social life or all 3 at once, i have NONE

for the last 3 years of being a depressed shut-in i didn't grow as a person at all i still have the same ambitions, when i ran into an old friend couple weeks ago he told me how the fuck am i still stuck in being a teenager, because i always tell the same jokes, do the same inappropriate things, talk the same...

my god it absolutely fucking hurts seeing my old friends being so normal, so happy, taking pic after pic from vacation, having beautiful girls, some getting married even, having decent jobs, a place of their own while i spend 80% of my time on reddit, youtube, facebook, watch tv shows, listen to music and play games sometimes

i can't see my life getting better because i've already tried some things and it didn't help, and good luck for me having a girlfriend because who the fuck wants a guy who is 22 and still living with his parents and basically never goes out, plus i gained like 20 pounds in the last 2 months, so not only i'm socially anxious and depressed as hell now i'm also chubby on top of all that, the only thing i do outside of the house is drive around with my bike every other day, visiting places i spent happiest and the most careless days of my life with my friends, i visit places where we'd get drunk and go to night clubs during 2011- 2013, then go out of town to see the beautiful landscape that makes me feel alive and then back to home

i had a decent life back in high school, it's like i peaked and my lfie is only going down the spiral, i never thought life could become this hopeless and hard"
628,"I've noticed the last few weeks, I've been sleeping a lot more during the day than I ever have, especially after interacting with my dad. It's not even something I can control, my body just shuts down for a few hours. The most infuriating part of it is that it screws up my sleep schedule, so I'll struggle more than usual to sleep."
629,
630,And that's exactly how I feel.
631,"---Update---

I just made an appointment to discuss therapy and/or medication changes. I've been on this road before (pre-baby depression) with a lack of results, but for the sake of my wife and child, I'm willing to try again. Wish me luck everybody.

---End Update---

Alright, parents and child-lovers everywhere - get ready to hate me. I don't blame you, and really I don't care. I can't be unapologetically honest with anyone I know personally, so you strangers on the internet are the only outlet I can use.

I have dealt with depression since middle school, so this bullshit isn't new to me. About 2 months ago, I and my wife had our first baby, and those two months have been the worst time of my life. I have been in dark places before, but becoming a dad has taken me to hellacious places in my mind that I never knew existed within me. For starters, I feel no love or connection to my baby at all. All I see is an obnoxious living ball of needs. I never wanted kids growing up, in fact, I have always hated babies and children under 13-15 years old. I only agreed with my wife to try for a baby because 1) My wife wanted a baby for most of her life, and I wanted to make her happy. 2) I thought the parental instinct and unconditional love would come naturally when she was born and I started interacting with her.

You always hear parents say that they love their kids more than anything, and they are worth all of the trouble they cause, but I strongly disagree. I want our baby out of my life until they are at least a teenager, maybe even forever.

I am a very analytical person, and I have gone over all of the feasible options available to me, and they are all so fucking horrible to me that I honestly prefer suicide over facing the rest of my choices and their consequences.

I love my wife with all of my heart, so the idea of divorce tears me apart even if it would let me be rid of our baby. I know what kind of life the two of them would live if we did divorce, and there is no way I could be that cruel. So I am essentially stuck staying in my marriage and keeping the baby, and I just have to suck it up and live with the worst fucking mistake I ever made. The idea of raising a baby, toddler, child, teen, etc is literally Hell for me and experiencing it is proving to be worse than the idea alone. Hence why suicide has started sounding so good.

My depression has always seemed to revolve around the notion that ""Life takes too much effort/work"", which really fucking sucks since a baby is nothing but Goddamn effort/work. I am literally forced to care for and sustain the worst trigger I have ever encountered for my depression. The more I interact with my baby, the worse my mental health gets. The less I interact with my baby, the shittier I feel about what kind of father I'm being, which also leads to a decline in my mental health. No matter what I do, I am in a perpetual downward spiral.

I don't want to hurt our baby, but I can't deny that the temptation arises when it won't stop crying. I find myself visualizing terrible things when I am desperately hoping it will shut the hell up.

I can't even put all of the words down for some of my feelings lately. I feel so horrible about the way I see my own child and even worse about the fact I can't do anything to make it better.

And before anyone asks, yes I have talked to my wife about this and to make a long story short, It didn't really help my mental dilemma. Nothing got worse by talking about it (besides learning she hopes to have a 2nd kid one day (hell no)), but she did not have any input that I had not already thought of myself."
632,"I can't maintain friendships. I can't connect with people. I push people away when I need them the most.

It is so hard to describe the feeling and experience. I look forward to my free time, I plan and structure my life so I have it. But when I reach that point it is like I've gotten dumped off, with a clear schedule and the world at my fingertips.

I should be enjoying life more than ever, but I don't have a social structure to lean on. I've grown apart from my friends and family. I make plans for my days off with people, but when they come I cancel them.

I just lay in bed and stare at the sky through the windows. The only thing that gets me up is caffeine headaches. I probably spent a whole hour today smacking the pull string on the ceiling fan in my bedroom and watched it for 5 minutes until it would stop moving completely and then I would smack it again. It was a boring, tortuous, and arduous experience but I wouldn't stop."
633,
634,"Lately it feels like everyone wants me to be ok for their sake. I'm sure they want what's best for me but they feel more inclined to not worry themselves and convincing me and them that i'm fine and that I will be fine. My therapist and my psychiatrist don't seem to listen to me when I tell them i feel the same or even worse. I don't know, I try to talk to my friends, my girlfriend, that love me and want the best for me but every time i trey to open up it feels pointless and leaves me feeling stupid for even trying"
635,I won a big marathon against billions lol.
636,Looking back on my life everything always seems so grey and dull.
637,
638,"I waste so much time listening to music and pacing. I imagine this fantastic new life I have and I am wasting so much time with family and friends and on my life. My life is passing away and I realize I will never amount to what I daydream and it made my depression go to a dangerous state. Do you guys do this too?

Edit: wow guys thanks for all the comments and upvotes it’s so incredibly reassuring that I’m not the only one with this. Thanks for all the support and advice I really take it to heart. I still haven’t really solved this problem but knowing I’m not the only one really helps thanks everyone I truly wish you all the best thank you"
639,"After a month of udder crippling depression, not only did I wake up and get out of bed I got dressed in a nice outfit and put some make up on... I think things are getting better. "
640,"She understood and we'll make an appointment with the doctor. Hopefully I'm on the right path to healing. :)

&#x200B;

edit: I wanna thank each and every one of you for the supportive and very kind comments. I love you all and I wish the best to all of you! We're all strong fighters here! Stay safe :)"
641,"I caught my wife lying about being somewhere when she was actually at a hotel. She’s threatening me with divorce if we don’t open our relationship. We have a two year old daughter. I just graduated college and all of my plans for graduation have fallen apart, I’ve been rejected from every fellowship I’ve applied to and interviewed for. I had a surgery two years ago that still is bothering me with complications. 

I can’t tell my wife, the only person I used to talk to about my depression or if I’m feeling suicidal.

I’m so tired of feeling this way. I’m in so much pain all of the time. I feel completely and utterly humiliated. I just want the pain to stop. Please help me. I can’t take this anymore. Please. I don’t know what to do. Fuck.

I don’t want to lose my daughter. I love her so much. I’m just so lonely, scared, and hurt. I just want the pain to stop. I don’t want to deal with this pain anymore. 

Is there a point when it’s okay to stop? I loved my wife so much, she was everything to me. 

I feel so broken.

Edit: I have read every single comment on my post, and deeply appreciate all of your support. You’re all channeling the anger I’ve been suppressing for a few weeks now. My family is really well connected in the legal community, I’m just hesitant to pull the trigger and start asking for contacts. Word spreads pretty quick and I’m not sure I’m ready for everyone to know right now.

Im taking  all of your advice into consideration and am going to take some concrete steps towards strengthening my position against her threats."
642,"Like I said. Daydreaming about the things I'd want to happen; about the things I can do, but won't, because of my social anxiety, which lead to my depression. Daydreaming about having conversations with people I know that probably won't happen. Daydreaming about not being lonely...

It's fucking exhausting, knowing that I can't make any of those dreams come true even though there's literally nothing holding me back, except myself."
643,"This world favors strong character: confidence, self-respect, charisma, determination, fearlessness etc etc. Obviously I don't add up to any of those. In fact I'm downright opposite. My life so far has been a history of failures and regrets. I'm so sensitive it's honestly embarassing. At this point anything is enough to send me into an episode. I'm too fucking useless and repulsive to succeed anywhere in life. I find myself constantly daydreaming about an imaginary world, where I actually have friends, where I don't loathe myself so much, where life doesn't seem pointless and I have a purpose
"
644,
645,"I really hate it when I try to explain to people what’s wrong and I don’t want to go into the nitty gritty due to a whole slew of reasons but saying “sorry, it’s my depression” just doesn’t seem to convey the weight and magnitude this illness has. I need a new name or word for it. "

"
648,"My wife was struggling with depression for about 6 months. She attempted overdosing in December, but I found out and called an ambulance. Yesterday she jumped off the roof of our apartment building while I was out. I don't know why I'm writing this. It might be to prevent others from doing this, but I think it is a more selfish desire to just say it  

I found out yesterday that she stopped taking her medication for about 7-10 days because the side effects were unbearable. I don't mean to diminish this, but I believe it was mostly in her head. She operated normally as far as I could tell, but was fixated on this idea. I noticed she got worse recently but I believed it was because she was putting  pressure on herself to get back to work. I guess I was wrong.  

She thought I would be better off without her. That the pain I was going through watching her was too much for me. I truly believe that when she jumped she was partially doing it to free me. I wish I could tell her how wrong she was. 

Now I feel trapped. I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel for myself but I also don't see suicide as an option. How can I put my loved ones through what I'm now going through? I can only hope that the saying time heals all wounds is correct. 


Edit: thank you all for your support. I promise that, despite the timing of this, it is not an April's fool joke. I really wish it was. 

Edit 2: thank you again for all the support. I'm going to see someone today and Friday. The funeral is tomorrow. It's going to be a rough few days. "

651,"I’m only 16, but I’ve already made up my mind: I’m never going to have kids. I can’t stomach the thought of passing my depression down to them, or them having to grow up with a parent struggling with depression. It just wouldn’t be fair to them."
652,"My okay days used to be decent, I wasn't particularly motivated or anything but I didn't feel like shit. Now my okay days are just days where I don't actively want to die but I still have suicidal thoughts and can't stop thinking about depressing shit unless I'm fully distracted which is really hard to achieve.

Edit: Thanks for all the words of support, it's really helped and I feel much better now I know it's not just me feeling this way, really appreciate it guys."
653,.... that it's a part of my personality now. The helplessness and pessimism is such an integral part of my life that I now feel like I have to cling to it; to let go of it would be akin to forming a completely new personality. Does that make sense?
654,"It’s hard fumbling about trying to think of something interesting when all I do is go on YouTube, play video games and go to class. Usually, I just go “not much how about you”. It’s embarrassing and sad, but it’s not like I’m passionate about anything else. I wish I was.

EDIT: Thank you for the gold, stranger! "
655,I made an oath to myself to never stoop so low and to cut myself again. I made it to two months without doing it until today. I had so many emotions going through my body and I didn’t know what to do with it and so I just took it out on myself. I kept on going and going until I realize I had to stop because I almost covered my whole thigh. I’m sorry for triggering or being to graphic to anyone. I’m having a really hard time right now.
656,"This has been a recurring fantasy of mine for years. I'm thinking, well, things can't get much worse, so instead of killing myself how about just leaving everything. Maybe go to a different country and starting over. I've been binge watching ""Disappeared"" a lot and can really relate to many of the people who vanished all of a sudden."

660,"I miss you so much. How did I get here? I look at old photos and I see a happy girl with insecurities, yes, but someone who was comfortable with who they were.

661,"I posted this on /r/suicidewatch before I realized this sub existed.

We have been dating for 7 months. I don't believe in love at first sight, but we fell in love pretty fast. We are great together. I can't imagine my life without her.

We both struggle with depression. I was suicidal a few years back, so I can understand what she is going through. I have been medicated for the past year and pretty ok; I convinced her to seek help, so she has been medicated for the past 4 months or so. Anyway....

I had just arrived at work. Only been there about 20 minutes, when I receive a phone call from her. We both hate talking on the phone, so when she calls it's usually because she can't text, so I answered and she was babbling; slurring; crying; the only thing I could understand was, ""I did it. I'm sorry.""

I bolted out of the office. She lives about 20 minutes away and by the time I got there she was in her bed laying there. I thought she was dead. I can't remember ever being that scared. I walked over to her and she was still conscious and sobbing. She had downed a bottle of wine and taken all her Klonopin.

I was able to get her dressed and take her to the hospital. She's in a mental health facility now and getting the help she needs. I'm just so afraid that when she gets out, she is going to try again and this time I'm not going to be there to save her.

I understand that it has nothing to do with me. I understand depression. I've been in a place, where no matter how much someone loves you, it's not enough. But, I can't help but beat myself up. I'm about as mushy and kind as they come. Spontaneous flowers, love poems, genuinely want to spend all my time hanging out with her, I listen and hang on her ever word, basically I know I'm a good and loving boyfriend. She kept repeating, ""I don't know why you love me so much. I'm horrible."" I tried to tell her that's not true.

Leaving her at the facility was so hard. She cried so much. She wouldn't let go of me when it was time for her to go. It's been almost a week and I miss her so much. We are never apart.

I know I'm doing everything I can. I just needed to rant and get some alternate perspectives. I went through a divorce a year ago and my circle of friends is relatively null, so I don't have a ton of people to talk to.

I'm depressed as fuck now. It's like this whole situation has made old memories and feelings come surging back. I'm not suicidal, but I sure would like to sleep for a couple of centuries. This is tough.

*EDIT* *UPDATE*

I saw her at visitation tonight and she was very upbeat. She is taking all therapy seriously and seemed to be genuinely happy for the first time. 

I feel a bit better about things. Thanks to all of you for your support. 

*EDIT*

She gets to come home this Sunday. Time to clean the fuck out of her house for her. =)"

663,"I was diagnosed with depression 5 years ago, my family was very supportive at the start, I had a girlfriend who loved me and I wanted to make her my wife.

But the years have passed and my condition has not improved, people just start to get tired and see you as emotionally draining. This caused my girlfriend to leave me, my parents to get emotionally distant from me and my friends to disappear.

Now I am alone, miserable and suicidal. I have no one to talk to about this. My job sucks, my life sucks, and I see no way out of the miserable pit I live in.

Depression not only makes you hate yourself, it makes everyone else hate you as well. 
"
664,"I'm so tired of hearing ""everyone's depressed"" and ""other people have it much worse than you."" Like I'm completely aware my life should be great and now I just feel bad for complaining?? Are more people really diagnosed now or are we just hearing about it more? I understand I'm not a special snowflake who deserves special attention because I can't control my emotions but also give me a break.  

*edit: aw, guys. this has really blown up in just over 24 hours. I'm so glad none of us are alone and it's truly comforting to hear your stories and points of view. I have a very hard time deciphering my emotions and figuring out what i actually feel and what i think i'm feeling. it makes it very hard for me to trust myself that i actually have a problem, a chemical imbalance, rather than a bad few weeks. many of you explained how i feel better than i ever would have been able to. i kind of wrote this as a rant because i've been frustrated with my ""support system"" blowing me off as just in a bad mood most of the time because i'm highly functioning. i go to work, i run errands, i see friends, but then i just come home and crash in bed with my clothes still on for hours and hours until i have to force myself to get up and shower and go to sleep. ""you just need to sleep more,"" or ""try to relax,"" or my personal favorite, ""have you tried meditating or yoga?"" HA. we've all been there. 

i still feel shame in admitting my depression, anxiety, or eating issues, because i do feel like i'm looking for attention when you drop a bomb like that in a casual conversation and i'd much rather fly under everyones radar. but i am getting help. i've been on medications for several years, and have seen therapists in that time as well. if you even THINK you may have something wrong or you have thoughts of ending your life, please go see a therapist. many places accept all kinds of insurances, including medicaid, so it's completely free. please look into it! take care, friends. ❤️"

666,"I'm a teacher and recently, have been told by management that I need to add more ""excitement"" to my classroom. Because of this, I've been trying to play a more comedic role, telling jokes, and so on. Today I realized that everyone I talk to... students, other teachers, or management, I wear this smiling face. Nobody sees my true colors. At the end of most days, I'm left feeling exhausted. I don't know if I can teach anymore. When I get home I just shut down, curl up in a ball and feel finally like ""myself."".

If you have this, what do you do to get it to shut up?
Additionally, whenever I do something stupid/embarrassing/not perfect, my first thought is always ""kill yourself"" even if it's just like I cut some onions not evenly or I dropped something. its really disturbing and I'm so tired of it. how do you get this to stop?"
670,"I’ve been having the worst time of my life these past months and in return, I’ve been late on assignments. My parents know that I’ve been dealing with really bad depression and anxiety lately and I’ve told them the reason why my assignments are overdue. It’s because I’m too mentally drained and unmotivated to do it. I️ can’t come up with anything to write because I’m too focused on how bad everything is. They never ask me how I’m doing, they ask me if I️ve gotten any homework done yet. And I️ just can’t take it anymore.

Edit: My parents do care about me, I️ know they do. They just don’t understand how serious its becoming. I know they’re trying to be supportive and understand what it is that I’m dealing with and why I️ haven’t been focusing or wanting to go to school but it’s hard to believe that sometimes when I️ just feel like they’re just trying to ignore everything that’s happening."

672,"So, I’ve had major depressive disorder for over half of my life. Do you guys ever feel as if every little task throughout the day is just exhausting, to the point where it feels like you need a break after accomplishing each one? For example, I know that I need to go grocery shopping, but even thinking about doing it is exhausting; so, I take a break after thinking about it. Then, I make a shopping list, which is exhausting; so, I take a break after making the list. And now, I’m faced with actually going to the store, which brings about a million other little exhausting tasks! For example, driving there, getting a cart, walking around, finding items, walking around some more, trying to control intrusive thoughts, walking around some more, then paying, then taking the shit to my truck, then driving back, then taking the shit out of my truck and into my apartment! Fuck! So many fucking things! I’m exhausted just thinking about it.

They are mostly idiots who are short on life experience and common sense, and long on hubris and a sense of entitlement. Many posts here lately receive comments that are just nasty in tone, and extremely judgmental, harsh and condescending in content. 

We really need the mods to crack down on this. I also request that you strongly emphasize that tough love has no place here. I understand that you say that on the sidebar. But I request that you say so in a more prominent place and in a more conspicuous manner. 

There are suicidal folks here whose lives may hang in the balance.

I strongly urge the mods to do something before somebody harms themselves after being publicly shamed in the name of tough love.

I think it's about time that we disempower the tough love acolytes and send them back to their Dr Phil reruns."
678,"im a burden, im toxic, i hate myself. 


loneliness began eating me whole when i realized no one is actually ever there for me. my friends has stopped trying to understand me.

it just sucks bcs before i fully sunk into this hole, i was trying very hard to be cheerful. i always went out of my way to make others happy or to try at least understand them. i always, always sacrifice my time, and love--something i couldn't give myself i gave to others. but its so sad when i realized everyone was so much happier when i wasn't included.

one time i just saw my friends having fun together and i stopped in my tracks to go to them. i stared from afar how joyous they were without my presence, therefore i maintained it that way. i kept avoiding them, i just didn't have anymore energy to hold a basic conversation. i cant even finish tasks anymore. im still friends, we still talk, but they know how i feel now ans they don't understand me. they thought i was just having mood swings. how i wish that was the case. 

cleaning the house takes me weeks to finish and i cant even do my homeworks anymore. im failing class and im failing life.


Tl;dr?

""It doesn't matter what I do or what I choose I'm what's wrong. There's nothing I can do about it. If I'm not hurting myself, I'm hurting everyone around me. There's nothing I can do about it. I'm... I'm broken.""

There were a few times where I tried to start my work, but instead just heavily procrastinated and browsed Reddit and YouTube all day...and look where I am now. I wasted the whole damn day! I'm on the brink of crying.

And you know those occasional days that feel longer than usual days, where an hour feels like two, maybe three hours? It was one of those days. And the feeling like I had more time than usual today makes this feel so much worse."

681,"*Edit: My use of ""triggering"" in the title refers to how I felt reading articles and comments regarding Robin Williams on the night of, not the anger I felt the next day after having time to think and refresh.*

It angers me to see posts saying ""If only Robin Williams knew how many people cared/ loved him/ are sad now."" In my bouts with depression, I wouldn't have cared if 7 billion people sent cards saying they care; or 10 page letters; or a 16-hour phone call. I'd still throw the cards or letters away or hang up the phone and think, *They don't really care. They just don't want my death on their conscience.* I'd bet money Robin Williams was the same way. Who could be more loved than a funny-man?


When someone tells me [in the context of suicide] ""I'd be sad if you died,"" I think, *Great, so I should endure my pain every day because you don't want to feel pain yourself.* I think, *How selfish.* How is it more selfish to desire an end to my pain than it is want me to remain in pain? It's easy for the other person to ask me to remain in pain. They don't feel it. They don't see it. Because if I show it, ""Hey, perk up. Be happy. Turn that frown upside down."" Depression isn't an on/ off switch.


And so I never want someone to do something they don't want to do. I can remember one time that all I wanted was to play a particular board game with a friend, but I couldn't bring myself to say that. I didn't want my friend to play just because I asked or out of some moral obligation. (And I know that if I did, at the end I'd hear ""Do you feel better?"" as if they were just going through a undesirable task to make me ""less sad."") Instead I just sat there and said and did nothing for the rest of the evening, watching my friend get frustrated and angry with me.


The Robin Williams posts are triggering, because they are filled with ignorant comments about ""caring."" If I die, millions will never know, much less billions, much less care as one /r/self post proclaims. Friends and family will move on, because their advice to me is always, ""Keep putting one foot in front of the other. Just let go of that bad stuff.""

Edit: WOW this post blew up. Can’t say I had the best birthday, but I very much appreciate all of the people who wished me to have a happy one, and it definitely made me feel better! Common themes that were brought up was that to increase enjoyment of birthdays, it is important to monitor your expectations, put yourself out there and be vulnerable, and know that it is common to feel this way, so therefore just make it your own celebration however you want to. Even if that means doing it alone and treating yourself. Best wishes and thanks again for your support!"
683,"I have tried so hard through most of my life to feel accomplished, to live a life I can be proud of. To love and be loved. But every day is another act of failure and rejection. The days get heavier and heavier. I’ve run out of strength. I want to stay in my bed. I want to stay in my dream world. 

I really, really don’t want to wake up. "
684,"All of my life, getting yelled at has absolutely been the trigger to bring me to such a low. It’s the feeling that I did wrong, and that I’m useless and a fuck up that slowly grows darkness over me. 

I am not diagnosed with depression but I have bad anxiety and I know that they can go hand in hand to completely screw your life over. 

Often, my moods fluctuate. I can have very high highs, where everything is good and I’m feeling beyond great, then with a simple trigger I can sink into this deep sadness where I go numb and have no interest in doing anything. 

I’m supposed to get a haircut today but I can’t seem to get out of bed. This feeling is scary and I hope for the best for anyone who deals with this. 

You are all loved!

685,"So episode 3 of the new season, at the end, Rick walks past his family, being a bit more quiet than usual, then walks downstairs and comes very close to completing suicide (he passes out at the last second.)

When I see a suicidal person on TV I feel like 9 times out of 10 they're standing on a bridge, weeping their guts out, waiting for someone to come along and talk them down. Maybe there's a crowd watching them, cause that's what everyone wants at their suicide: an audience. Now this obviously does happen, but I don't think it's the majority of attempts. Those might be more likely to be a ""cry for help"" scenario  (which is no less serious and tragic than someone who is fully committed to completing suicide. If you're standing on the edge of a building or taking any sort of steps towards suicide because you feel that's the only way you're going to get help, then you are really desperate for help.)

Anyway, for a person who has been suicidal for a long time and doesn't want anybody interfering, I feel like this  is so much closer to how it goes down. Family is home, they don't notice much different about the person, and it's completed without a lot of fanfare. You just want it done. It reminded me of Hunter S Thompson's suicide. His adult son was in the next room and thought he'd heard a book drop.

Rick is also one of the only characters I can think of that has depression and successfully hides it. He comes off as angry and mean, which is exactly what my husband has been saying about me. I'm angry all the fucking time. Because I'm in pain and I want to die, and I've used up all the fucks I had to give just getting out of bed today. I have no patience or kindness left for people annoying me or being stupid. Still, most people who know me have no idea how sick I am until I tell them.  

Rick and Morty likes to make you laugh at something, then force you to think about why you were laughing. Rick is a funny old drunk grandpa. Old people who are always taking swigs  from their flask and don't give a fuck are funny, right? Except nobody drinks like that without a reason. Healthy people do not need to be constantly drunk, the hangovers and cost to your health are enough to keep most people to some sort of reasonable level of consumption. Also, most people just don't feel the need to drink from when they wake up to when they pass out. 

Rick Sanchez makes me feel like somebody gets it."

687,"I hate my life. I’m stuck home with my depressed parents who make me feel guilty if I try to have a social life as though i should be at home moping around with them instead. It’s gotten to a point I feel selfish for wanting to go out with friends and if I do, I’m miserable. But I love being around people. I love talking and doing things with others but I can’t anymore. I don’t have anyone. "
688,"You know, I went down my list of contacts, seeing whether there is anyone I would have liked to say goodbye to or say anything too really. Nobody. Not a single person. I told my wife I love her and she will be fine. Both are true.

Edit/update : I don't really know what to say, I honestly didn't think my post would be seen by anyone at all. I feel like now I owe everyone an update.

I did take the pills. I ended up taking a cocktail of about 70 pills of varying drugs. I was planning on taking twice as many, but my wife walked in and saw me (I thought the room was securely locked) and freaked out and took all the rest. I was too out of it to even challenge her the benzos were kicking in hard, and she called the emergency line. Ambulance picked me up, dropped me off at the hospital, and I was told I wouldn't be seen for 5 hours (UK hospital). The idea of having to wait that long just to be seen just reinforced my feelings of being totally rejected and low priority in society. I left. I got more pills and took them. I told my wife, and she wouldn't stop calling me and calling the police. She wouldn't stop calling and it drained my phone. Literally the only thing I felt like doing was listening to my favourite songs as I passed. That's all I wanted. The closest place I could think to go was the hospital cafeteria, which was still relatively close, and I had a charger with me since I was expecting to spend some time in the ER anyway. The sockets in the cafe were all disabled, but thankfully the socket in the hospital chapel was not. I spent about half an hour there charging my phone, and my wife had phoned half the city by that time, including my university support. As soon as I turned on the phone, I got a call from a private number that turned out to be the hospital asking where I was since they were ready for me. I admitted I was in the chapel, and that's where they found me huddled up in a corner, a nurse and 3 security guards saying they were there to help me. That was 7 hours ago, I'm still here and the hospital staff have treated me terribly ever since. I know that this sounds like it's supposed to have some kind of happy ending to it, but quite frankly this entire experience has just been dehumanising and has made me realise that there should not be any more half-measures. I'm not happy I'm still here. I'm a hostage and they're forcing me to stay against my will ""for my own safety"". I've been through the ER routine more often than I can count, but this time has been more nightmarish than I could have possibly imagined. One way or another, I will never be going back to the ER again.

On a more positive note, I cannot begin to thank or repay the many kind words I've received. My inbox is practically full, and in some ways so is my heart. It makes me feel guilty that I still feel awful, but I do. Your words are so kind and sweet, but I'm still really struggling here. Thank you all so much."
689,"I just wanna now if I'm not alone...

Edit 1: I really appreciate all your replies, I read them all and will keep reading.

I can safely say feeling disconnected from everything is what makes us the most damage, despite having all of our basic needs satisfied. I guess we all have to learn how to survive with this instead of fighting it, and sharing our thoughts here helps with that a lot.

It’s been 3 days since then, the doctors said it’s really bad but might not scar. I’m in so much pain guys I honestly wish he just killed me that night instead. I had to clean my wounds and it was so horrifying seeing your own raw flesh it’s just not meant to be seen man. 

Worse day of my life. I’m not able to move out of bed at all currently. I’m feeling like shit atm. I just want to say that I hope you guys are getting through life better than I am. I don’t know if I’ll ever feel safe in my own house ever again. I’ve had sleep paralysis every night since of the incident. Look all I’m saying is I really hope you guys are having a better day than I am, please make sure your eating well and taking as much care of yourselves as you can!

EDIT: Okay so this got way more attention then I wanted, but thank you so much for everyone with their well wishes and support. I was overwhelmed when I woke up to this, I truly was, and I was scared in a way to address all of this. 

Firstly, If you guys want to see my wounds as you guys don't seem to be believing me, I will post a picture of the bandages, or if you guys want to see my actual wounds, I am willing, as I am getting the bandages changed at the hospital today. This post, more than anything, has made me realize that this sub is sacred to people that are going through bad things. I would never post a fake story and take up anyone's time. I understand why you guys would be suspicious, and I am willing to do whatever to prove myself. The reason I posted this was because I felt like shit and alone, and I needed to justify the pain I was going through, so I wanted to kindly ask people to be grateful for what they have, as it can always be worse, myself in this very moment included. Instead, almost a thousand people have heard me, and have supported me. Funny thing is, I've actually missed some resits for uni because of this and I might have to retake a year, and this thread has made it feel much less worse.

Secondly, my Father. Hes a good man, but this is the last time, he has promised to me. I belive him. I think the world of my parents, but things won't ever be the same between us. This is the last time, I love him, but this is too much.

your life isn't a tragedy to friends and fam, it's a black comedy. you don't get love and support by publicly suffering all the time. only by being great and happy all the time and having a bad day that one time. then they care.

I've always had severe social anxiety and did what I could to avoid talking to people. I tried dating a few times in my life but the relationship wouldn't last more than a few weeks. I would be extremely nervous and wouldn't know what to say but I would tell myself that every other guy on the planet can do this so I can too. It finally dawned on me that I have no social skills and can't hold conversation to save my life. You might think I'm over exaggerating but you'd be wrong. I really can't think of anything to say. Even if you were to give me a list of things to say I'm not intelligent or quick witted enough to hold a 5 min conversation let alone hours upon hours of talking to someone I'm interested in. It's like my mind is a blank slate the never got programed. I tried therapy and meds but I finally realized it's hopeless. There is something severely wrong with my brain. I hate myself so much and I would do anything to be a normal guy with a normal love/sex life. I have a bunch of other problems that make me depressed but I've already written enough here. If you actually read all this, thanks for listening to me vent."
712,"I feel physically unable to leave the bed today, and I don’t even care if I get fired.

I just don’t want to today. Maybe tomorrow. Fuck me."
713,"I'm happy when I've been sleeping. No worries or cares from this life to bother me. Then, I wake up and am sad. Sad because I'm still alive. Sad because I'm still the same me. All of the other issues in my life that make me depressed come back to mind and the joy that sleep brought slips away so quickly. "
714,"No calls, no cards, no emails - nothing. It's a big birthday. I always thought I'd be surrounded by my loved ones on my 65th birthday, but not one of them ever calls or writes or sends even a Christmas card to me. One day I'm going to die in this goddamned apartment and nobody will know until they smell something bad and realize they haven't seen me for awhile. Then they will all act so sad. 

I remember at my father's funeral, some man was there talking about what a good friend my father was. I looked at him and said ""Who are you?"" and then I asked him ""If he was such a good friend, why don't I know you? I'm his daughter and I've never seen you in my life.""

When I die, nobody will come to my funeral. Nobody will give a rat's ass that I am dead. That's why I'm donating my body to science.

UPDATE: Just want to thank everyone who posted well wishes or shared their life stories. I wish I had more time to answer all the replies. It really did lift my spirits, though, so you did what you intended to do. This is one reason I love Reddit and why I love young people. They really have such good hearts, but I think maybe they don't want to face their own mortality quite yet, so they tend to turn away from older folks like me. I was the same way when I was younger.

Anyway, thanks again! "
715,"I do this all the time, like I really want that feeling of happiness so I smile, but it never comes."
716,Do you ever wish you just run away and start over? What would you do? 
717,"I gave myself a year. My birthday is tomorrow. There’s nothing worth living for, nobody loves me, the only reason anybody ever cared about me is that they had something to gain. When I’m gone they’ll forget about me in a little bit."
718,"You helped everyone, gave em a smile! Asked if they were okay! But then you realize that not a single one asked you back? Friend or Family? 

It's kinda lonely, some'll even call you stupid and say you wouldn't understand. Well...it doesn't matter either way"
719,After school i don’t feel like doing anything. I just wanna lay in my bed and sleep or watch Netflix
720,"I've been a subscriber to r/depression for a long time; I suffer from both depression and anxiety, and am currently taking medication that helps considerably. 

I guess I just need to get it all of my chest, and I apologize if it's a bit long. 

My parents divorced December 2012. After that, my father and I became very close, as my mother was exhibiting very selfish and irrational behavior that ended up pushing a lot of people away. My father was my mentor. He was my friend. He was a great man. 

In December of 2013, he passed away at 48. I'm 24. It was horrendous. I lost him, and was thrown into a massive storm of shit to deal with since I was the executor of his estate. 

A few weeks before his death, I began dating a girl. She was the perfect fit for me. She was smart, caring, and incredibly empathetic. When my dad passed, she began spending a lot of time at my house with me and my friends. She helped me through a lot. 

About a month and a half ago, she left. A half-cocked story about needing to find herself, and now I'm on my own, and still dealing with the aftermath of my fathers death. 

I was still not on good terms with my mom. She was not being a mother. She continued to disrespect my fathers memory, portray herself as a victim, and cut down the ones I cared about. Time and time again I gave her a chance to step up, and she failed to. 

This past week, my mother committed suicide. She wrote out her list of next of kin, took a handful of prescription strength sleep aids, and went to sleep for the last time. She decided she would rather be dead than reconcile the relationship she had with her children. 

My sister was just admitted under a 5150 as a last ditch effort for her to end her self destructive ways and get her life on track. It doesn't look promising. 

I sit here, smoking a cigarette, with my two dead parents dogs lying at my feet, and am overwhelmed by anger, loneliness, and defeat. 

I'm trying to keep myself from shutting myself away from the world and crawling back to my old hermit ways. 

If you took the time to read this, I thank you. I just needed to vent. 

And to add something; for those of you struggling with suicidal thoughts, as I have in the past, please PLEASE seek help. Don't do this to those that care about you. 

EDIT: Wow. I wrote this last night before getting some rest, and I woke up to a whole lot of positive feedback and support. I can't tell you how much it means to me. 

For those that sent me PMs, I will get back to you as soon as I can. Thank you to everyone here for being so supportive - you guys seriously have no idea how much it helps. I'll be going through everyone's response today. "
721,Sorry for the little rant. I’m poor and ugly. Don’t hurt me.
722,"I want to cry so badly sometimes but my body just won’t let me 

"
723,I'm so bored of just sitting in my room for the whole day watching YouTube videos or lying in bed til it's nighttime and I can go to sleep again. But whenever I have something I need to do or when I was employed and working everyday it was so fucking difficult and I just wanted to die. 
724,Then go right back to the empty feeling of nothing where you keep wasting life. Seconds of snapping out of it then back to bring controlled by depression.  I hate that split second I open my eyes when I wake up 
725,this is a wretched fucking existence and i want to end it.

728,I sold my PC and drum kit for a handgun a couple days ago and I'm planning on using it tonight. I'm going for a long drive into a secluded area and ending it here. Life is simple in the moonlight bye Reddit.

730,"Has anyone ever asked if you’re ok? 

Like, gee whoa, you certainly talk about killing yourself a lot. Are you ok? "
731,"is how bloody incompetent it makes you. I'm stuck waiting outside my therapist's office for an hour, because I can't hold a time in my mind for literally the two minutes it takes to go from phone call to note app.

I'm so much worse at literally everything."
732,"Today during class, I drew what depression is like for me. It sounds weird, but it made me feel better for a while. Anyways, here it is.

It means a lot that you guys appreciate it, and I'm glad I made something finally that people like. Thanks again, I love all of you and have a great weekend. :) "
733,"3am again stuck in my own thoughts again.
It seems I hold such a low opinion of myself, that I just can’t accept a compliment for what it is but rather find a reason to deflect it. Do any of you feel this way? "
734,"I'm grateful for the times I'm *not* depressed and can function fairly normally, but I've noticed that when I'm in the midst of a depressive episode my thoughts about the world seem to be a lot more accurate (and bleak).  And then I wonder if it's better to be depressed and honest about life, or to be in la-la land."
735,"They spent so much time, money and effort for me to turn out like this. I wish i had to energy to work or go to school so i don't feel like i wasted their money to be a lazy fat ass who sleeps all day and eats their food. I don't have the energy to leave bed most days I don't even know how i can find a job or think of a career to study."
736,"I don’t know how it got this bad. I’ve always struggled but this is on another level. I’ve spent almost the last 3 years in bed every single day and night. Luckily I work from home, but I do that in bed as well. I realize it’s not healthy I just have no motivation. People have made jokes that there will be an indent in my bed from me never leaving it which is so embarassing. I don’t want to be like this anymore but i’m terrified of trying meds. I took them in high school and they made me almost manic. I said and did a lot of stupid things on them. I just want to feel normal again 😞. "
737,"Today I was feeling shitty from the moment I woke up.

Nothing was going right. First I got yelled at by my mom, then I fucked up an important exam.
 
I basically have a self-harm kit in my bag (razor in my phone case, gauzes and bandaids...) and I was really planning to just go and cut in the school bathrooms.

But then math period came. I usually don't do anything in math and fuck up most of my exams there. But lately I've tried to understand what we were doing there. 
And today, the teacher told me to go solve a problem on the whiteboard.
And after I solved it, my teacher said:

 ""See? You're really good at this!""

I almost fucking cried right there. I didn't actually feel like a worthless piece of shit for once. And you bet I didn't touch that razor today.

Some people dont know what even the smallest compliment can do to a person. So yeah, shoutout to my math teacher, she really made my day with this.
"
738,What the fuck is wrong with my brain. 
739,I have no interest in anything anymore. It just sucks. I sit around all day motionless occasionally maybe listening to two seconds of music but then turning it off after being unable to concentrate. I hate this.
740,"I decided I was done cutting a month ago, and although I still really want to I haven't cut at all. My arms even look somewhat normal, which hasnt happened in years. Just happy and felt the need to share it."
741,I do feel relieved that someone knows now but I also feel kind of embarrassed that they had to see that side of me. I just feel vulnerable 
742,"I recently got a 40 hour a week job, its been great, I wake up, go to work, go to sleep, repeat. When I am there I listen to music or a podcast and then I go home. Once I get home, on the weekends, I am almost non-functional. I want to die so bad right now and the voices are once again coming back full force, beating me down to the point where I can't focus on anything, I just want to cry and sit in bed, or stab myself repeatedly with a knife. Instead I sit in front of a computer and game for as long as I can. Most of the time I am completely alone with my own thoughts on the weekend. 

Even now my mind is yelling at me. I dread the weekends. "
743,
744,I brushed my hair for the first time in a week.
745,"Hello everyone. First off, as I'm sure is the case for most of you, this post was extremely hard to write. I don't like complaining about my depression/anxiety because life is stressful for everybody. I am in a pretty good situation overall, with a good family, great girlfriend, great friends, and a nice apartment. Yet, despite all that, I feel so incredibly shitty most of the time. It makes me feel guilty - why should I feel like crap when I have it so much better than probably 99% of the world? Yeah, everyone gets stressed by work, traffic, money, etc but it's called life. 

These are thoughts I have all the time which is why I don't like to talk about my feelings much. I see a therapist and I don't really mind bitching to him because he gets paid to listen to me. But I absolutely hate talking about it otherwise. The thought of making my problems other people's problems is horrible to me. 

Another thought that I have is do I just use depression/anxiety as an excuse to avoid my responsibilities? Like am I just not mature enough to deal with real life so I can just say to myself ""hey I'm depressed so it's okay that I don't give maximum effort?"" I am so easily distracted and have such a hard time concentrating.  I often just think I'm incredibly lazy and that I use depression as an excuse which in turn gets me more depressed. Has anyone had these thoughts before (and apologies if this has been discussed in this subreddit - I'm brand new here). I just don't feel like I'm cut out to deal with the real word. I don't have whatever ""it"" is to be successful professionally - between social anxiety, inability to concentrate, and just extreme dread of working or doing anything productive.

Anyway, thanks for reading. I know this is a giant ramble. Glad to have somewhere I can just write down all my incoherent thoughts"
746,"One day, that quiet kid will commit suicide, and come his funeral, his parents and siblings will be crying. But none of his classmates will say a word because they never spoke to him. They will remember the times their eyes moved past him as if he were part of the wallpaper. How many times they forgot he was in the room. Isn't it tragic that the only time they remembered he was with them at all was the day he left the world? 

Good luck to you, fellows, who are like me. Depressed and lonely, and waiting for the end of it to come."
747,I wish I could rewind at times and fix this mess. I see all these lives I could have lived and I fucking hate myself. I think about all the things I did wrong and things I should have did but I didn't. 
748,"that’s the best i can explain how i feel, i guess. it’s odd, but the only thing i’ve felt for a while now, so is strangely comforting due to its consistency. i feel as if i’m very detached from my own body, and am sometimes taken aback when i see myself in a mirror and am reminded i am in fact a genuine, human person.

my downright depressingly pessimistic view on the universe and it’s inhabitants - that it’s all fake, in a way, and everything is very much temporary, having no long lasting impact - probably doesn’t help this feeling. it’s not a lack of awareness; i’m almost hyper-aware of everything (sometimes called creepily observant). i don’t know how to describe it, really. just a constant state of being “out of it”.

i was just curious if anyone else feels the same way? let me know if you do and we can try and explain it to each other :)

edit: wow i forget how awful of a typist i am. i must learn to proofread for the amount of typos i make haha

edit ii: i’m surprised this post has gained so much recognition in such a short space of time. although it’s sad that a lot of us seem to be struggling with this, at least we’re not alone (ew, cheesiness)

750,"Im a 19 year old male. I sleep with a stuffed animal and I cuddle with it and talk to it like it's a girl. I literally can't fall asleep if I don't do this and it makes me feel so fucking pathetic. I honestly cant think of a less pathetic thing for someone to do. What the fuck is wrong with me?

752,"I feel so proud of myself for not letting myself succumb to the depression today and actively fighting my lethargy! Even though I know that tomorrow morning I might disappoint myself, I won today's battle. Try to remember that every proactive thing you do (no matter how small, like making coffee) is a huge personal success! 

(to clear things up, I have taken to sitting in the shower since summer was over due to a lack of willpower/energy which results in longer, depressing showers instead of invigorating like a shower should be)

754,"I have depression since childhood and nothing has ever been done until I cut my wrist once. 

I hate selfharming. I never had an urge to do it, but it did feel like something you had to do to ‘prove’ you’re depressed, especially when you’re a teenager. If not, you’re seen as someone who’s just sensitive and complains a lot. Other illnesses like anorexia also seem ‘necessary’ to have to make people finally realize that you’re mentally unwell. 

Even my own parents saw my suicidal thoughts as an afterthought at first. When I confessed to my teachers about my selfharming, they finally tried to find a therapist for me. "
755,January was incredibly difficult. February is proving almost as bad. I don't know if I'll make it to see spring.
756,"Is really just code for ""sorry I didn't reply, I didn't have the energy to talk to anyone or engage in any sort of human contact so I laid in bed for 4+ hours, in the middle of the day, listening to music and thinking about how horrible everything is.""

Me right now."
757,"I've reached that point in my life, where NOT feeling depressed feels weird to me.  I'm just so used to that numbing feeling of uuuugh, that to actually think of life without depression just makes me roll my eyes.  Like that will ever be possible.  I can never just be happy.  There always seems to be some sort of catch.  Happiness seems to come at a price.

I've also noticed that after feeling happy, that I just *crash* hard back into depression and I feel worse than before.  I sometimes compare happiness to a hard drug.  The high is amazing and uplifting, but you fall from that high deeper into depression and you crave that happiness.  

I'm also anxious 95% of the time, even when I have no responsibilities or things to worry about.  I could be sitting down on my bed listening to music and then be having an intense panic attack.  I dunno, this might all just be me.  I just wanted to vent."

760,"It’s all fucking commercialized shit. Fake joy. Artificial happiness. Fake fake fake

Fuck everything"
761,"I just want to start off by saying that mental illness doesn't discriminate when it chooses its victims, I am just speaking from my perspective.

In no way am I saying that my mental health struggles are harder than people who comes from a different racial background, but it is difficult when you come from a community that stigmatizes and fails to recognize mental health as a REAL issue. From my personal experience and those of other black people I know, majority of us grew up being told that ""we're being ungrateful, weak, crazy or sad for no damn reason."" I am sure that other people have been told these things as well, but this is all too prevalent in the black community.

Recently, I have sought out professional help after experiencing a mental breakdown on campus. I was extremely grateful to be paired with an understanding psychologist. After the school year ended, I came back home and had told my parents of my experience with this doctor and exclaimed how much he helped hoping it would change their mind about going to a doctor, but they shot down the mere thought that anything outside of the bible could help me. The claim that ""going to doctors is what the 'world' does (they're pretty religious). All they want to do is put people on pills"". That is the furthest thing from the truth. Not once did the man I met with suggested that I be placed on any sort of medication and even if I were, I would be willing to if I needed it.

I hate that I am nothing like my family. If I believed in god, they would be more accepting of me. But I am at the point in my life where I feel that I want to believe in what feels right for me. I want to be my own person, not who anyone else wants me to be.

I just wish that my parents and other black people who still hold on to the same mentality could just open their minds to the fact that ACKNOWLEDGING MENTAL HEALTH IS NOT A BAD THING!

UPDATE: I thank and commend all of you for sharing your experiences in the comments. In the place of “African-American” I originally had “Person of Color” because I am aware that this problem  is very relevant within other groups. This was basically me speaking from personal experience and you all have definitely opened my eyes to what other groups endure.
Stay strong everyone. No matter where you come from, no matter what you look like, your problems do not deserve to be invalidated or told they are not real. I am proud of you all ❤️"

Turns out we seemed to have a lot in common and we got along pretty well. We both left at the same time and when we walked out she asked me for my number. I'm just in total shock that anyone would like me enough to ask for my number, my awkward depressed self. Totally WEIRD"
764,"I always catch myself thinking about someone and how much I like their company or attention, but then self-doubt creeps into my head and I realise that I don't even cross their minds. It makes me feel weird and lonely, I always start to feel real shitty. Anyone else?

You don’t want to be around people,
 but you don’t want to be alone 
You don’t want to do anything,

766,"This has been my routine for a while now. Add in toilet breaks and eating food on the side. Sometimes I watch TV too and on days I'm feeling perky I brush my teeth and have a shower! Pushing the boat out right?

Living life on the very edge here. Or merely just killing time. I'll go with the latter. I don't feel very alive even gaming is more of a crutch to me than enjoyment."
767,"I've always struggled with depression and anxiety, but the past year or so it's become a serious problem for me. I started seeing a therapist and started medication, and it's helped me tremendously. However, trying to explain how serious of problems these are for was really difficult. How do you articulate something that you've had your whole life? It's not like I really knew the other side, so to speak. It was frustrated not having people take my problems seriously.

SO…I made some photographs (all self portraits) that aim to describe how I feel. I've always been a more visual person anyway. Hopefully others find some type of comfort in this. Let me know what you think!

I seem to have lost my personality completely, I don't act the way I used to. I rarely have anything to talk about and I can no longer make people laugh. I also feel myself becoming too cynical of recent, and i'm starting to think i've become unlikable.

770,"I didn't know how to phrase the title to make it shorter, but I am realizing this right now as I'm in the middle of a crisis. I'm depressed, suicidal, but also pretty anxious (especially socially anxious) and the one thing that is keeping me from jumping off the balcony is anxiety. Because I don't live alone, I feel like I wouldn't be able to kill myself without panicking. I don't want to be seen, I don't want to be acknowledged. The attention I would get alive, unconscious or dead is too much for me to handle if I think about it now. Just thinking about it makes me panic, and by trying to avoid the anxiety, I try not to think about my death. 

While the depression keeps me in my room almost all the time (yay, apathy and anhedonia!), which helps me avoid most situations that would otherwise lead me to a panic attack. 

So I guess that's a good thing, isn't it?   


Edit: Oh wow, you guys. I was not expecting all of this at all. I wrote this kind of in the middle of a really bad mental breakdown, while trying to give myself reasons to get out of bed the next morning. I'm sorry it took me so long to come back to this post. But thank you so much for the replies. I have read all of them, and will reply. I hope all of you have a great, great day. Let's keep our heads high! :)"
771,"I don't see it being discussed much. It makes me feel rather isolated. I don't think I even remember joy. I only seem to recall fear and deep sadness. 

I've been depressed since I was 9. I suppose I was genetically predisposed to it as it runs on both sides of the family. A lengthy move across the pond, and the bullying that went with being the new, weird kid at school triggered it. An inferiority complex due to a learning disability only made it spiral uncontrollably. Most people my age (I'm turning 18 next month) seem to be so excited about life, but I only feel helpless. I am exhausted at this point in life, and feel like I can barely keep up with the ever so busy and growing world. 

Depression has taken all interests and motivation away from me. I have a rather vapid life with a personality to match. 

I'd be open to read your experiences and feelings! 

Edit: Wow, words cannot describe how relieved and elated I feel to know that I am not alone. All of you have dealt with such terrible experiences I wish no one had to go through. I wish all of you nothing but the best! I am exhausted on all planes of existence, but I will use what strength I have to carry on. We must all move on. "

I need help.. and some peace of mind, has anyone gone through this? is this familiar to anyone, I've never heard anything like this before, like my mind has betrayed me.. or just, given up on me.

778,"So yesterday was my 14th birthday, got up in a good mood looking forward to it just to find that none of my friends really did care, same for my family. My family mainly just ignored me that day. But on that day they bought my older brother, younger brother some stuff likes clothes and video games (rounded up to $500 all together). But even though it was my birthday they didn't get Me anything not a cake, not a hug, not even a simple ""Happy birthday"" or ""Love you"". Just ignored me.

780,"So, as in the title, One of the few things that makes me not fall in complete despair is knowing that I do have this way out. Just want to know if anyone knows what I'm talking about. Like, it came to a point where thinking about suicide actually comforts me enough to not do it. Am I a idiot for thinking this way?"
781,"When I'm around other people, I laugh boisterously and crack jokes like it's my fucking job. People think I'm this confident, hilarious guy who enjoys the fuck out of life. Of course, I can't blame them. I mean, I'm full of shit. That's the image I project. I can't help it. I just do it without thinking about it. But all I really want is for someone to understand the crippling melancholy that forms the foundation of all my jokes. I want someone to see through it all and just acknowledge how fucking hopelessly sad I am. The hilarious thing is that all it takes is a bit of honesty. Yet honesty feels completely unnatural to me. I can't be honest about my feelings. I just can't. I can face a wall and tell it about how miserable I am. But replace that wall with an actual human being, and suddenly it becomes impossible. I *pay* my therapist to listen to my true feelings, but as absurd as it is, I can't even bring myself to tell him just how dark my inner world has become.

I'm sad, Internet strangers. I'm really fucking sad. All the time. "
782,My mom is my best friend in the entire world and I couldn’t do that to her. I wish I could.
783,"I just want to say to everyone here that didn't get a response to their post, I'm sorry. I'm sure there are tons of us. Too scared, anxious to respond. From time to time I just go here and read people stories, their life and their problems. Most of us here have similiar problems and I'm 100% sure even though you may have not got a response you were hoping for, that there are people reading your stories, your problems and that they would want nothing more but for you to get better, even though they are too scared to respond."
784,fucking sick of this happening to me all the time
785,"It had been 4 months since I woke up to my uncle’s call telling me what happened. I feel so lost, I thought it will only get better but it doesn’t. I lie to my therapist so she wouldn’t ask to see me more. I lie to my friends. I have no other family. I have never been close to my uncles and aunts. My parents were everything in me and my sister’s lives. I never imagined life would be this hard. I never thought there is a jungle out here. 
I need someone who felt/feels the same to tell me that It will get better. I don’t want to feel alone in this. "
786,I do it many times. Posting this alone was a struggle.

788,"I was in my car this morning ready to kill myself (or at least trying I always chicken out). I went out driving looking for something like a bridge or a really sturdy tree so I wouldn't have to take anyone with me. That's when I drove by this massive LITTERING IS ILLEGAL sign and guess what? There's a fuckton of litter thrown around the sign! At this point I was beginning to somewhat calm down. I turned around and parked on the side of the road. I picked up litter for about 30-60 mins in the hot southern sun. Luckily I had a cheap duffel bag I wasn't using. Felt like I lost a pint of sweat (my fatass sweats a lot). After that I just got in my car and drove home. It's kind of amazing how such an inconsiderate act like littering became one of the most considerate things anyone has ever done for me.

Edit: Thanks for the gold"
789,"My grandma said I can’t handle things well. She doesn’t even know what I went through. I hate it when people judge without even having all the information. And of course she went on to talk about her own problems, and how she thinks of herself as a superhero for going through them. I love her, but that’s lame."
790,Like you’re just so ugly and awkward and disgusting that you should never show your face again. Like you’re an embarrassment to the word human. And people are just getting second hand embarrassment just from knowing you’re in the room.

793,The first few hours in the morning are almost unbearable...
794,"It feels like I already know how I’m gonna die— suicide. I can do all I can to prevent it from happening, but it’s like a curse that can’t be broken. I can’t escape this fate. Terrifyingly, this is becoming the reality, the longer I live, the more I want to kill myself. Now, it’s just a matter of figuring out when."
795,"I’m typing this from the waiting room of the ER. I finally decided to get help. I’ve checked myself in for suicidal ideation. I’ll be spending New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day in a hospital. I’m really proud of myself for mustering up the courage to ask my mom to drive me here. I hope this experience will finally help me in someway. I hope you all enjoy your New Years festivities. 

EDIT: Today, January 4th, I got discharged! Thank you all so much for your kind words. Spending 4 days disconnected from the outside world was tough but I know now it was absolutely necessary for me. Please get the help you all deserve. I'll be in an IOP (intensive out-patient program) for the next 6 weeks, I've started medication and for once I can say I have hope for the future. Here's to recovery in 2019."
796,"I just watched the Andy Whitfield documentary Be Here Now. He was the title role of Spartacus in the Starz series years back. The show was a hit and he was no doubt destined to do great things moving forward, but he was suddenly diagnosed with lymphoma cancer and died 18 months later. He left behind a beautiful wife and two children. He seemed to have been a decent and talented guy all alround and did not deserve to die.

I'm just a 27 year old pos working a crappy job and getting drunk every night. I'm short and ugly and will never find a women to start a family with. Why did a great guy like Andy have to die instead of me? Fuck cancer."
797,I’ve felt like this for quite some time and can’t quite shake it off.
798,"I've suffered with depression all my life, I was raised by narcissistic parents and spent most of my life feeling alone and like I didn't fit in. My wife was the same, and when we found each other we found more than a spouse, but someone who could relate. I can't describe my love for her, we complete each other.

Around 5 years ago she was diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer for the second time (at age 20) whilst she was pregnant with our daughter. We lost our daughter to stillbirth, but my wife somehow pulled through, had chemo and got an all-clear.

During this time both of our families proved themselves to be thoroughly selfish, useless and downright nasty so we both went no contact and it was the best thing we did. After four years of healing we got married and life seemed to be getting on track.

Last month I took my wife to A&E because she was passing out and having trouble getting her blood sugar under control, only for them to tell us, after a few more tests, that despite having no ovaries left the cancer had returned, somehow spread to her lung and liver and there is next to nothing they can do.

She is due to start chemo soon, and is in an awful lot of pain. She has been prescribed morphine for it, but due to that spends most of the time sleeping, while I sit here and watch over her, making sure she is ok.

The trouble is I can't talk to her about any of this, it's too painful for her to do anything but ignore at the moment but I'm devastated and alone. Besides, how I feel should be the least of her worries at the moment and I don't want to put that on her.

I feel like I'm already grieving her even though she is still here, I'm completely alone with no-one to lean on for support.

I've already lost so much and I don't know how I am going to cope when I'm here alone. I feel like I'll probably just see out my cats life and then take my own, nothing feels worth doing if I can't share it with her."
799,"When you can't come up with an answer to ""what to do?"" question.

Fuck, I'm really feeling like shit. "
800,"I spend all day on Reddit so I don't have to think about things that stress me out. The stupid thing is that there are things that I want to do, yet I always put them off until tomorrow. I've wanted to start a webcomic for quite a while now. I have a tablet and can download Photoshop for free from my university, yet I haven't drawn a single panel. If I can't even get myself to do something for fun, how the hell am I going to survive life?

I'm on winter break right now, but it ends in 6 days. Before winter break, I promised myself that I'd apply for the study abroad program that I need for graduation, but I haven't started that either. I'm so nervous about asking for recommendations, since I haven't had any professors for more than a term, due to switching majors twice. I know I need to just do it, but the more I put it off, the more anxious I get.

**EDIT:** Wow, this post got so much more attention than I was expecting. I'm really glad to know that I'm not the only one struggling with this. That being said, I think it's time for me to really make an effort to disconnect myself from Reddit. To help me in this process, I'm going to be deleting this account, so I'll have less of an attachment here. I've read every one of your posts here. Thank you for sharing your experiences and opinions, and I wish you all the best in overcoming your struggles."
801,"So there we were arguing who fucked up the relationship, she'd never agree that it was her fault. I'd always apologize even if I was wrong. I refused to apologize and it all fucked up. She knew I had depression when we were in relationship. I told her I feel depressed and she said ""There's no such thing as depression""

Anyway, she found out from out our common friend that I visited my doctor to get help and will begin medication soon. So at the end of the chat,I told her I'm not okay and she is making me feel even more bad, she should just leave me alone, so she dropped the bomb and said ""I don't give a fuck even if you die""

I stopped texting her after that. I was already having suicidal thoughts, but since now she wants me to die, I fucking won't. Fuck you.. I'll outlive you , you stupid piece of shit.

EDIT: Just came home and saw your replies. I'm overwhelmed seeing your responses. In the process of opening up and sharing my experience with you, even if I can help one person, I'd be the happiest person in this world."
802,"I just found out that my hairdresser is one of the people who bullied me a lot earlier in my life. I didn't recognise him, but he suddenly asked if I was DNAli3n, and we had a long talk while he did his job. He apologised for what he did and how he acted, and it removed a big load from my heart. Just wanted to share a ray of sunshine"
803,"I've spent 4 hours lying on the bed this afternoon. It's so hard to convince yourself because there's nothing to look forward to, nobody to talk to and you cannot find the reason for self-care. It's easier to stay in bed and struggle about things like self-hatred, sexuality, all the types of relationships and the future than to take steps to improve the situation. It's so hard when you have no emotional support, nobody cheering you on and nobody to go through things with you, step-by-step. 

Nobody's listening.

I'm aware that I cannot and should not rely on other for validation, and I cannot seek their help all the time. I'm aware that only I can change things. But as soon as I'm trying to be independent, everything just falls apart immediately. 

Why am I like this? I just want the demons to go away. I don't need to be happy, I just want this to stop."
804,"What the hell is this bullshit.

Edit: Thank you for the Gold. It's very kind."
805,
806,"The title pretty much explains it. I don't understand the point of being honest with anyone if people give you dumb answers regarding the way you feel. Yeah they might actually care and that's their genuine answer, but perhaps I don't care about their dumb answer. I think I've become basically just numb. I don't want people to know how I feel because they just act angry towards me. What goes through people's minds. I could understand frustration because you feel unable to help me, but people act angry towards me. I don't want to ever talk with my dad regarding my mental state if all he does is be angry at me.

Edit: Thanks for all the support and compassion, I thought I was an idiot for feeling this way but lots of you guys experience the same! I wish you all the best and hope things get better for everybody <3"
807,"i get jealous of other people’s abilities, talents, and achievements, since i have none. i also get terribly depressed when i hear stories of other people’s supportive families, their possessions. this makes me seem toxic and irritated out in public, when in fact i’m trying to cope with my worthlessness. i especially can’t stand people who have a tendency of humbly or subtly bragging. those people make me feel like absolute shit. 

does anyone else experience this... sense of loss? is it valid, or am i acting like an asshole? "
808,I’m gonna be all by myself on NYE. I keep telling myself that NYE is overrated just to make myself feel better. But who am I kidding? I hope you guys have a good one and a happier one than mine!

810,"I have a brain tumor and the doctors told me my memory is going to get worse and worse. At first it was only little things, but today my friend was driving me home and I totally forgot where I lived. My road that I have lived on for my whole life seemed totally new. I had to think really hard to remember which house was mine. I've been crying for the past 4 hours over it."
811,Did any of you ever thought about you depression beeing fake and you just make it up to get attention? Or am i the only one feeling like that
812,"So much shit has been piling on and on. I feel like I am not making the people I care about proud and the only reason they talk to me is because of pity. I am scared of not being able to reach the expectations my parents have of me.

I will not take my own life, but if a car hit me, I got a terminal illness or if something fell on top of me. I would not be sad about me being gone."
813,"I feel like for as long as I have been depressed, I am  reliving the same day over and over again. Sometimes I just watch the clock change from 11:59 pm to 12:00 am and see the date change and think ""Yup, another day feeling the same way"". Time is moving forward and I am not. "
814,"I tried to hang myself today but I was too scared. It's a painful way to die. I wish I wasn't scared of the pain. I want to die so badly. I wish I had a gun or poison. There are so many people on this planet anyway and death is just a part of life. I wish I could just buy a pill.

Edit: 
Thank you for your kind words. I really appreciate them. It's good to be reminded that I'm not alone and other people struggle with this too. 

To those telling me to see a therapist, I am in therapy and have been in therapy for 10 years . I am currently on medication, just increased my dosage about a month ago actually and have a doctor's appointment scheduled for next week. I've been in this battle for a long time, I've worked hard, I've tried many things and sometimes suicide feels like the only rational option."
815,I dont want to exist. I dont want to deal with all these emotions. I hate myself. I know people around me would no doubt benefit with me gone. I dont want to kill myself. It would just be another giant cost to my family who doesn't have much money to begin with. I'm an accident. Nobody wants a fifth kid in their 40s. I wasn't meant to exist so why am I here? If I wasn't here maybe my parents could've bought a house instead of renting their whole life. Maybe buy a car that the bumper doesn't fall off on. Maybe they could have enough money to retire soon. I just wish I didn't have to exist to be a burden on everyone
816,Feel like all the best parts about life i can only dream about.
817,"Like i dont feel like i have any problems, but the thought of killing myself just doesnt go away."
818,Biggest fucking lie I've ever heard. 
819,"I've noticed for a while that I'm forgetting things very easily. I can't remember the good memories I had with my friends whenever they bring up some past event. It's like my head is just erasing all of the memories I have, and it's making me more depressed than I already am. Does anyone else notice this too?

I thought maybe it has to be with depression, at least  it's my guess. Otherwise it could be just me."
820,"My life is a mess right now. Everyone's ignoring me, and I can't stand being by myself. But at the same time, I want to be kept alone.

I don't know what I want to do, but even if I try something, I can't push myself to stay productive.

What am I even doing to push my life forward?!

Sometimes I feel so useless. Even I don't know what I want."
821,"Hey people without depression who think I'll be cured by working out and eating better guess what!!! It doesn't cure it!! I run every other day and eat healthy with lots of vegetables, I journal, I do yoga, I go to individual and group therapy, I'm on medicine, hell I even have an essential oil diffuser to make my room smell nice. I make my bed and clean my room every day and stretch out morning and nights.

All neurotypical minds probably think I should be not depressed right now but guess what I still am!!! Doing all those healthy things makes my overall mood higher but it doesn't cure what's going on in my brain. I just want people to know that I'm trying hard and I still am not on neurotypical level like they want me to be. Thanks for coming to my TED talk"
822,"You have to take care of your body. Brush your teeth, shave, shower, get regular haircuts. Eat varied, healthy meals. Exercise regularly. You need a varied and fashionable wardrobe for social occasions.

You need money to support yourself and your lifestyle. You have to work or study for years to advance in anything that's not a dead end career. You have to deal with your boss, with your coworkers, with your clients. You have to deal with a thousand other people in a cutthroat environment who all want the same job or that promotion. You have to devote at least 40 hours a week to this, sometimes more.

You need to develop your identity and your personality. Find what interests you and pursue it. Have hobbies, read books, be an interesting person. You have to maintain a social life on top of all this. You have your family, your friends, your significant other. Birthdays, anniversaries, Thanksgivings, Christmases. Mandatory social obligations. Gifts. Money. Endless conversation. Most of it is fake. There are so many unspoken rules and customs involved in social interaction and you're not allowed to show weakness. It's a constant, tiring charade and everybody knows it's an act but it goes on and on and on.

This is a fucking rat race. It's too much responsibility, too much chaos. I can't handle it all. How do people do it? I don't think I was meant to be human."
823,"In July 2013, a redditor told me on a comment thread that he was planning on killing himself by age 21, and I just wanted to say:

Have a happy birthday, and remember that we here at r/depression care! I know this year has sucked, and I'm here to let you know that it WILL work out, and if I care enough to remember your birthday when you told me in July, others do too. Stay with us, death sucks, don't die, and PLEASE don't end yourself because you DO matter! We love you! 
"
824,"It turns intelligent, kind people into zombies who can’t wash a dish or change their socks. It affects the ability to think clearly, to feel anything, to ascribe value to your lifelong passions, your relative good fortune. It scoops out your normal healthy ability to cope with bad days and bad news, and replaces it with an unrecognizable sludge that finds no pleasure, no delight, no point in anything. 

You alienate your friends because you can’t comfort yourself socially, you risk your job because you can’t concentrate, you live in moderate squalor because you have no energy to stand up, let alone take out the garbage. You become pathetic and you know it. And you have no capacity to stop the downward plunge. You have no perspective, no emotional reserves, no faith that it will get better. So you feel guilty and ashamed of your inability to deal with life like a regular human, which exacerbates the depression and the isolation. 

If you’ve never been depressed, thank your lucky stars and back off the folks who take a pill so they can make eye contact with the grocery store cashier. No one on earth would choose the nightmare of depression over an averagely turbulent normal life. It’s not an incapacity to cope with day to day living in the modern world. It’s an incapacity to function. At all. 

No one chooses it. No one deserves it. It runs in families, it ruins families. You cannot imagine what it takes to feign normalcy, to show up to work, to make a doctors appointment, to pay bills, to walk your dog, to return library books on time, to keep enough toilet paper on hand, when you are exerting most of your capacity on trying not to kill yourself. 

Depression is real. Compassion is also real. And a depressed person may cling desperately to it until they are out of the woods and they may remember your compassion for the rest of their lives as a force greater than their depression. 

Have a heart. "
825,"And I’m not talking about tired of life (Well not mostly.) I’m tired. All the time. No matter what I try to do, I can’t stop being tired. Exercise? Tired. Stay in bed all day? Tired. Try to socialize? Tired. Be alone? Tired. Eat or not? Doesn’t matter. Tired. Not matter how much or how little I sleep, I’m tired. I can’t find fun in anything anymore."
826,"I'm 20 and I feel like absolute shit. This past year I've been doing nothing and I've been letting my illness ruin my life completely. I could have been doing something, anything, but I let it all go away.

I'm trying to make the most of my time now, but, it's hard, and I feel so bad... and I feel like I'm out of time and I can't have the experience I could've had. And most of all, I don't want to get older."
827,"The worst thing about these two things together is how boring I must be to other people. I'm either too afraid to do things with people and don't like myself enough to engage in social activities, or I'm so depressed that I don't have the energy for it. If I do try doing things, I feel like I'm faking some bullshit personality anyways. I would 100% change my personality if I could, but it just always gets too uncomfortable too handle. Being alone is comfortable and familiar."
828,"I was doing so well. I was excited to be alive for the first time in many, many years. I thought I had finally begun a new, positive chapter in my life.  

Boy was I wrong.  

I'm sinking back into the depths of this insidious disease and losing my will to fight it. The older I get, the more I see suicide as an inevitability.  

I was not made for this world.  

I'm lonely. I'm lost. I'm afraid. And, above all else, I'm tired.  

What a cruel joke to be ripped from the womb and thrust into this absolute wasteland.  

Welcome to hell."
829,"Most days I feel like i'm in the middle of the ocean, gasping for air as I bob up and down trying to scream for help. Yet yards away are a beach, a beach of my friends and family. They know the signs, they know what ""drowning"" looks like, yet they do nothing. Just stare. Just stare as I try to keep my head above water. 

No matter how hard I scream, no matter how much I wave my arms hoping for someone to notice and help me out. No one moves.

Its just me. Alone. In the middle of the ocean. Praying I can just keep my head above water for at least a day."
830,"Now first off I feel it's imperative to say that I haven't officially been diagnosed with anything; in fact I haven't even talked to anyone about how awful I've been feeling the past year or so.  However I feel I definitely have a lot of the symptoms that those diagnosed with depression have (also of note, I do not feel suicidal at all).

I suppose the title of this post is a bit hyperbole, but I was thinking that if I did talk to someone and they prescribed some type of medication I would not feel comfortable with taking it.  I mean for one, I have a lack of faith that it would even work (but maybe that's just me being cynical and/or naive) and for another it seems like even if it did work it would lead to a contrived happiness as opposed to a genuine happiness.  Even just talking to someone I feel like I wouldn't properly be able to open up about what I've been going through. 

...And sometimes I feel like (and this is going to sound just awful) that I'm just using depression as an excuse or outlet for just being lazy or not taking an initiative in life.  I mean, there are times where I am happy...it's just seems like a rare occurrence.  I feel like I'm feeling sorry for myself.  I mean I have a great job, I'm only 23, I make very good money, have a nice car/apartment, etc.  But something just hasn't been feeling right...and it seems like it's a combination of multiple factors.   

It seems like it would all be an exercise in futility.  Maybe instead of talking to someone or taking medication I just need an escape via some new activity or something.  I just feel as though an attempt at trying find genuine happiness is very stressful and borderline impossible."
831,"After having to take a medical leave from a good college because of my depression and social anxiety, what I did today made me extremely happy. I hope I keep doing better.

Edit: thank you for all the support! I think this goes to show that any step you take to better yourself, no matter how small, is significant. I love this community."
832,"Is that depressed people are honestly some of the nicest, open-minded, loving people I have ever met/talked to. We all know how it feels to be in the darkest places, and we don't want to see anybody go through that. I feel like a lot of us would stand by somebody and help them through anything they needed. Whether it be big or small, depressed people know that there is no such thing as a big or small problem. Problems are problems. People just like to point and act like they know what we are going through. Like we are the mud on the bottom of the shoe, and can't ""Lighten up"". 

I really don't know any of you, but I already know that you are all some of the best people out there. I know how strong you all are, how loving you all are, how open-minded you all are. In some weird, seemingly contradictory way, you all are the love that is needed in the world. 

 Nobody wants to talk to a depressed person, but a depressed person would talk to anybody."
833,"This is becoming a problem. This is not the first time this has happened either. I am surprised I have not been fired. I just can't get up. I am so unmotivated. Help! What can I do?

Edit: I am currently in therapy twice a week and taking antidepressants. I also have been working with my Dr. to get a healthier diet and exercise routine. All of these things have help a lot. But I still can't seem to get up and face the day. "
834,"Every week I buy a packet of strawberry bon bon's from the same shop because I did that every week when I was 12 and I associate the flavour and the smell with coming home from school, excited to spend the weekend playing video games.

I buy an energy drink every Wednesday because that was the night I used raid with my old WoW guild. Best times of my teenage years, and every Wednesday I had an energy drink alongside me. I'll probably do it tomorrow, too.

I stay up until 5AM regularly because I long to feel like I did when I was 14 and I remember staying up watching old movies I'd never seen before. I no longer get that sense of awe.

I used to eat pizza from the same place because I used to do it with my old band. The only place we ever went to and whenever I eat there I feel like I'm back in those days. 

Occasionally I walked the same route home that I did in High School so I can fantasise about getting home to talk the girl I fancied on MSN. That was a decade ago, though. MSN doesn't exist, she's moved on and I don't have anything to look forward to. 

The pizza place shut down recently, new management who can't make pizza worth shit. I fucking cried because I felt like that part of my life was finally gone. 

I wondered if, in 10 years, I'd be doing the same things but to re-live the memories I'm making now. I don't know if I will.

Depression has successfully taken away my ability to make new memories. Now my old ones are becoming harder to hold on to.

**Edit:** Hey everyone. I woke to an overwhelming response, thank you all for kind words, advice and for sharing your own tales of nostalgia. This is a hard subject for me, I look forward to the future but the past is special and I never want it to go away entirely. 

I'm not one for unique experiences, the memories I have were never holidays or the first time I kissed someone or when I left high-school, but rather a broad feeling because at some point there was a part of my life that was really good and even though doing it once was fun, doing it over and over and over again cemented it into my head as a source of overwhelming positivity. Hopefully by making broader improvements to my life they'll start to form again.

I'll continue to read the comments for as long as this post remains relevant. Thank you, if anyone else is trying to get one over on depression too, I'm right along with you."
835,"I realized that today. This little furball shows me a very specific kind of affection. She even learned how to give ""human"" hugs. Everyday, sometimes a few times a day, she hops on my knees, takes her paws and face on my shoulders and purrs loudly, knitting my shirts and sweaters with her claws. I never saw her do that to anyone or anything. Just me. 

Not always, but most of the times, when I'm stressed or I feel low, she storms into my room and just does kitty things. Sometimes she interacts with me, sometimes she allows to pet her without doing anything back, sometimes she's just there, having an eye on me. Also, she always sleeps in my chair, next to the bed. Almost everynight. 

Today, I felt suicidal since the morning and I was even making plans, but another session of a kitty imitating human hugs made me research the topic of cat feelings. It turns out, that those little creatures can get depressed when their owner is not around and overall it stresses them out, gives them anxiety, makes them apathetic and waiting for the owner to come back. 

As ridiculous as it sounds, I don't want to cause any harm to this little thing and that's what keeps me alive. "

837,"I know that it’d help... but it’s so difficult for me to clean, cook, whatever. I get fearful of it, actually, find myself tearing up whenever I tell myself I have to clean, change the sheets, do laundry, etc. I know this is a common symptom of depression, blah blah, but my life is spiraling and I wish I could take some control by having a clean environment, but this fear / anxiety is overwhelming. :("
838,"I don't know if it's just me but the best bit is sleeping. It's not part of laziness, it's the fact that you don't get to live the world during that time

You don't get the stress of this world but just doing nothing. Even if it's lying in bed it's enough.

When you sleep you aren't comparing how miserable your life is to anyone else and nothing could matter at that minute"
839,"10 minutes ago, I sat down on my bed, I had my 9mm cocked. I held my gun next to my head but never actually pointed at my head.

I was scared. I couldn’t do it. I kept telling myself that it’ll all be over soon. Just point it my head, quick little pressing my of fingers and it be all over. I won’t feel it probably because it’ll happen too quickly for my brain to register the pain. Told myself that in just a split second, I won’t have to feel pain again.

I couldn’t do it. I felt like a fucking coward.

Edit: thanks for everyone’s kind words and support. It means a lot :)"
840,"I haven't had a friend in almost 10 years. I used to have lots of friends and then everyone moved on with their lives.

I'm quiet and have social anxiety and it never really got better. I thought my life would change but it never did.

My parents are all I have.

I've never had a job where I earnt more than minimum wage. I have a degree. It didn't make any difference.

I joined a running group. I am always stood on my own and I feel very awkward and uncomfortable.

I am no different now than I was at 16. I am forever stuck in the summer after high school. I am scared that this is it and I will live like this for the rest of my life. I am genuinely terrified that if my parents go I will be completely alone. I want to cry but I am too despressed. I never made the life progressions that everyone else makes and I am in a daze wondering how and where it all went wrong. It feels like yesterday that I was in my teens."
841,I feel like all my friends hate me. The people that truly know me resent me. I feel my presence isn’t enjoyed — just tolerated. I’m the clown of my group. I’m always the butt of their jokes. But yet they always want to hang out. Probably because I’m too nice. Probably because I have a car and everyone just uses me for a ride. I don’t know who’s really there for me and who’s just taking advantage of me. I’m better off alone. I don’t even know how to have a friend...
842,"Hello everyone! About two years ago, on the anniversary of a near-suicide attempt, I posted an album here of different drawings I had made to cope over the year. The response was overwhelmingly positive and really encouraged me to continue pursuing my art. A lot of time has passed since then, and I’ve gotten a lot healthier as well as more skilled artistically, as it really helps me express myself in a positive way.

This project has taken me about 6 months to complete, and it’s been hard, but has really given me purpose and meaning. I cannot thank you all enough, for the role you have played in encouraging me to take this thing art thing more seriously. It has revolutionized my mental health.

So this project is something I've been working on for a while lately. It's called ""The Banality of Monsters,"" and it's ten ballpoint pen drawings, each with a corresponding text piece, telling a story about depression. Don't worry, I'm not selling this project or anything, I want it all to be free. I just want to draw. It gives me purpose. Thank you all so much for your support.

843,"Fucking sick of waking up every fucking day to drag my ass to somewhere I don't even want to be just so I can come home, get high and play videogames. I'm fucking sick of pretending that life is some grand adventure that should be cherished. Fuck this shit I'm gonna eat fried chicken every fucking day till i have a heart attack"
844,Spent most of today laying on my bed staring at the ceiling listening to music and watching youtube videos on my phone. Loneliness is so boring.
845,"I know, Im really late on having my first kiss. Today I finally kissed my crush, and it felt wonderful. For a moment, all of my problems were lifted off my shoulders and I felt like someone actually cared about me. I just thought I would share this with you guys, because for me right now in my life, its about all I have.

846,"Hello everyone. As the title says, a year ago on June 20th I hit my lowest point. I had close calls before, but this one was worse. I was going to throw myself in front of a train. After that incident I decided to get my act together. I started seeing a therapist and being more open with my friends about myself. In addition, I started to draw again. 

Some of the stuff in this album I have submitted to here or r/Anxiety, and it's been pretty well received. This is the first time I'm submitting almost everything I've done up til now, so I hope you guys like it and this helps you cope. Please tell me if this is harmful and I will take it down immediately.

847,Now i can save so i can get myself out of this shitty place i'm in rn. Wish me luck
848,"I always try to make room for at least an hour and a half or so nap every day in my schedule and today I came across an unexpected few hours of free time and tried to sleep but I wasn't tired and realized just how often I sleep to avoid the pain that comes with being awake. Wanting to sleep but not being physically tired enough to do so is a whole new kind of torture I wasnt prepared for. I just want to sleep, I dont want to deal with the pain I wish I could just have some peace and quite and curl up somewhere cozy and just fade away"
849,"I had a mental breakdown in January and my boss told me I either had to quit or keep working 50+ hour weeks. He could see I was in no state to be working. My family and friends also could see it. I quit and moved back home after my mother and friends were basically begging me to. They were all so worried and were afraid I would attempt suicide again. I’ve been seeing a psychologist once a week. Taking my meds every single day. Going to the shops and taking up hobbies so I can feel joy. All of it has been extremely emotionally draining but I have finally reached a much more stable place. So with the go ahead from my psychologist I started looking for part time work ( full time may be overwhelming so I’m easing back into it). I’ve been on a trial a few days last week at a cafe and really enjoyed it. Being around people and having a purpose feels so amazing. I got the job yesterday and start in a weeks time doing 28 hours a week. I am so proud of how far I have come due to all the hard work I’ve put in and all the amazing support from my family, friends and my partner. I am so proud of my self and genuinely excited to be working again. (I wanted to share because I am so happy and want people to know).

Edit: this got a lot more attention than I expected!! I am so grateful for all the supportive messages and all the people who I have given hope to. I wish everyone the best of luck and am extremely grateful for all of you ❤️"
850,It seems only in my dreams does the feelings of hopelessness and unhappiness goes away.
851,"I often just only sit or lay in my bed using my phone to watch videos or maybe play a game, since i have nothing better to do. I don't feel like doing any homework at all. Sometimes i might get my ass up and use my computer. Does anybody else experience something similar to this?"
852,I know I do :/ 
853,"You can cuss me out with insults, you can treat me like a subhuman, you can spit in my face, whatever. But please, please don't ignore me. I want my existence to be acknowledged. I want to be sure that I'm not just an invisible pair of eyes roaming around, witnessing everything happening without anybody noticing I'm there, like I'm an outsider looking in. Please don't make me feel any more isolated than I already do, like I have no friends who genuinely care about me. I know I suck, and I know I fuck everything up frequently, and you're welcome to hurl expletives at me for it. I deserve it. But whatever you do, I'm begging you, *please* don't act like I'm not there at all."
854,"i feel stuck in my current situation, even thinking about it stresses me out. when i explain it to people, they say it sounds like excuses, me being lazy, me feeling entitled... every day i want to go out and do something about it. i don’t want to feel like a leech on society and absolutely hate feeling that way, but i just feel like i’m damaged beyond repair. i barely interact with people. i barely leave my apartment. i feel like i’m incapable of functioning properly in society, no matter how good my facade of being a “normal person” is."
855,
856,"You might think this is a joke. It isn't. I've wanted to kill myself for a long while now, probably since around 12 years old. The only thing that alleviated my depression when I was younger was Fallout 3. It was the best game I'd ever played. I swore to myself when I got bored of FO3 (two years after it came out) that I wouldn't kill myself until Fallout 4 was released. I didn't count New Vegas, because, well, it sucked. Now that 4 is coming out, I don't know what to do with myself. I still want to die, but I can't just keep pushing it off until the next Fallout release. I'm addicted to the series, yes, but I'd like to have some motivation to live other than a video game. I feel so pathetic. I've attempted suicide twice before and been admitted to a ward for two weeks once, which only made things worse. What else is there to live for? People generally bore or upset me. I have a girlfriend, friends, family, pets, a job, everything I could really ask for. I'm not allowed to get medication as I'm still under my parents insurance. I'm working on going back to therapy, but my parent's think my depression is just in my head.  I'd really love some advice, or just someone to talk about random shit online with. 

I hope people don't see this as some kind of joke. Just writing this has helped, to some degree. 

Thanks.

Edit: Fallout was released last night at midnight. I'm feeling pretty good about it so far, but it better have some damn good replayability cuz fallout 5 is probably quite a ways off... I'm honestly surprised to see how much attention this got. Its really pretty cool that other people can empathize with me. Thanks all."
857,*big sigh*
858,"I’m basically done with living at this point in my life. I already wrote my note. I’ve basically planned out when and how I’m going to do it. Everytime anything good has come into my life my I ruin it with my depression and anxiety. I just don’t know how to be happy anymore or make others happy anymore. All I ever wanted was to be loved and I wasn’t good enough to get it from anyone when I needed it. It’s now been 8 years of me waking up everyday feeling tired, lonely, ugly and depressed. I just want to rest. I just want peace. The only way I’ll be able to achieve now is through killing myself. I’ve made a couple posts on here and I just wanted to thank you all. Everyone who’s commented or upvoted to show me I’m not alone in this world and I’m not abnormal or crazy. That’s meant more to me than most things my entire life. I truly and wholeheartedly hope you are all able to find pure, unadultered happiness and love in your lives, the emotions I couldn’t. This is probably my last post. Thank you all again so much for everything you’ve done for me and continue to try and live long happy lives, please.

Edit: Hey everyone, I’m still here. I had planned my day to be over a week away since I still have things I need to do before. I want to thank you all again for the kind words and messages. Reading these comments, the messages everything. It’s the first time I’ve cried happy and not sad tears since I was just a little kid. My mindset is still fairly firm unfortunately. I want each and every one of you to look at your own message and the messages of others and realize how full of love and life and kindness you all are. Given what this post is about this will be hypocritical but if you guys found out how to give the love you gave to me to yourself instead, this world would turn into a place I’d enjoy living in. I don’t know any of you, but I still love each of you for what you’ve done and said for me. Please try with all your hearts to live the long and happy life I won’t be. Never give up the faith that I have. Lastly, always be kind to everyone, including yourself. This Reddit will change and save lives because of all of you. Thank you again, and rest well."
859,"People don’t understand, sometimes I want to say stuff about how I’m feeling or talk about my depression or anxiety, but I just don’t. I just think if I tell my friends or anyone anything they won’t understand and think I just want attention. Sometimes I literally type whole posts on here and don’t post them because I feel like people won’t care. I don’t know why I do this to myself but I can’t help it. I just hate myself for doing this to myself."
860,"Then I have to be the big bitch, instead I just ignore it, which could possibly be worse. I don't know how to explain it, but no, you don't make me happy because I'm too depressed."
861,"Lately I have to keep my mind occupied on something, or else I feel like breaking down, like a damn that's about to burst. I keep fantasizing about a fictional version of me that isn't so broken. Someone who has made something of themselves. I've been watching hours of youtube and inserting my self into those videos and it's just making me more depressed. Someone who is normal and does normal people things. I feel like someone on the outside looking in. I still find it easier to just day dream than feel anything ""real"" in my actual life. Else I just feeling like killing my self. "
862,I’m not sure how to go into any more detail than what the title says but it seems that religious folks and most not only born agains believe that finding Jesus will make every single life problem go away. It doesn’t and yet they still keep insisting that it will.
863,"This again. I have to be up in 3 hours. I can never sleep because my mind never stops racing and it’s awful. All the reasons to hate this life, all the reasons to hate myself, all the things I could do to myself. Funny how little does everyone know that I hate myself more than anyone could imagine, I constantly wish I could hurt myself as punishment for being the sore loser that I am, and wish I could be dead because I feel so worthless in this world that it would be easier than trying to fit in.

I hate depression."
864,"This past year has been so scary because I’m noticing that my sadness and lethargy is turning into uncontrollable rage. Everything sets me off and I lash out at people who are only trying to help me. Ex: Yesterday I was cooking, and my mom asked me if I washed the vegetables. Instead of replying like normal and saying “yes”, I started yelling at her for over 30 mins and acted like an asshole to someone who was only checking on me. Same thing happens when I misplace something or have to repeat myself. Someone next to me parked bad? Let me yell/rant about it and exhaust myself and everyone around me.

Immediately after, I feel like absolute scum and want to cut/drink/do drugs/kill myself because I’m making life unbearable for everyone around me. I know how awful I am to be around and it makes me hate myself more than I already do.

For background, I’ve been living at home for the last 8 months after having a massive depressive episode my last semester of college. I want to go back in the fall but I feel like a massive embarrassment as a 23-yr old “super senior” and as someone who was always good at everything. 

I’ve always been known as “nice girl”, smiley and compliant. But now I get so fucking irritated to the point where every nerve in my body is on edge and my stomach is twisted. Like panic attacks but anger. I’ve never been physically violent in my life but sometimes i get this uncontrollable urge to cause damage. I feel so out of control and like a crazy person because my moods come so suddenly and I can only ride it out. It’s like I’ve become a different person. I’ve been replaced by a different person who’s cold, twisted and bitter. And what gets me is that there are parts of me that crave the anger and volatility. "
865,"i can't help feeling this way all the time. i look at the people around me and they've accomplished so much and done so much more than me. when i look at myself i see nothing special or interesting and it hurts more because i feel like i was supposed to be more, but i'm just nothing."
866,"I feel like my brain has just rotted into swiss cheese. I used to have an incredible memory and now I can't remember what I did this morning (although doing nothing every day helps in this regard). I can't remember teachers names from high school or college without putting serious effort into it and even then I can't remember all of them. Seeing something about derivatives (math) and realizing that I took and passed calc 1 in college with a B but I literally can't remember what derivatives actually mean much less how to solve them is depressing in itself. It's like whatever work I managed to do 5-10 years ago is meaningless. It also makes the thought of going back to school impossible. 

I'd give anything to be average and to not constantly walk around forgetting what I'm doing or what I wanted to say. "
867,Sometimes I feel like people would appreciate my existence more if I were dead. Why is that?
868,"My attention span is shockingly short, I forget things all the time, and my thoughts are all over the place. 

The worst thing has to be the memory problems. I forget shit all the time. What chores I'm supposed to do around the house, and whether or not I took my meds this morning. 

I also have a lot of trouble focusing. I can't get anything meaninguful done because my brain is so scrambled. Even driving has proven dangerous a few times. Sometimes I doubt whether or not I should be out on the road. I can hardly read a book for enjoyment because my mind is so disorganized.

People close to me think that I'm inconsiderate, lazy, and selfish, but I'm actually trying my best. But they won't hear any of it. They always see ""if you wanted to, you would"" and while I guess that might be true, it doesn't change the fact that I forget shit all the time.

On top of all this, the lack of energy makes me not want to do the things I *do* remember, so it's like an obstacle course of things I have to get through before anything gets done. I have to actually be awake and not sleep all day. Then I have to remember what to do. Then I have to have the energy to do it. Then I have to have the focus and overall mental competence to do it properly.

I feel like I have the mind of an eighty year old at age twenty, minus the wisdom and experience.

"
869,"I saw this [here](http://i.imgur.com/UeOLWhV.png) and thought, fuck, this is my life. Every night I wish I could sleep and sleep and sleep."
870,"It's Catch-22. Fuck this shit.

EDIT: Does anyone want to talk? Maybe we can be a bit less lonely together."
871,"I know depression makes it hard to remember things in the short term, but I feel like depression changes my memory in a way that I never hear anyone else talk about. After a depressive episode, I feel like everything that occurred before that episode is from the distant past, like in another life, and I have a hard time remembering it or connecting to it. Even after I have fully recovered from the episode.

My last episode was during last fall, and even though I got better in the spring, I still feel like I have a hard time recalling my life before the fall. It just feels like everything is so different now, like I moved to a different town, but I didn't.

I don't really know how to explain it, but it is just a distinct feeling to me. I am really curious if this happens to other people.

Edit: Wow. I did not expect so many replies. I know this is not even remotely the worst aspect of depression (at least for me it isn't), but even after I'm clear of the depression this still haunts me. And I have had to explain to people over and over again that my memory is bad, and I can't really explain why... sometimes it's even hard to convince myself that I'm not just stupid or flakey. But hearing that this happens to so many other people too... I don't know. It sounds cheesy but it just makes me feel like I am really not alone in this. I know there are other people out there who understand. Thank you for your comments :)"
872,"Like your life is too boring? Like the fact that you have no friends and no prior relationship experience and nothing exciting about your life makes you not good enough? There was a guy I was interested in but I've decided its not worth it because a) I'm sure he's not interested in me and b) he has great people around him, does great things and really lives life, while I'm this shitty pile of nothingness."
873,Fuck.
874,"I am a mental health counselor and student pursuing a Masters degree in Social Work to become a therapist.

I spend all day helping those who are depressed, suicidal, self-harming, anxious, but I can’t seem to apply any of the coping skills to myself.

I’m so depressed. I cry all the time over the smallest things. I daydream of relapsing back into cutting, even though I’m 3.5 years clean. I’m so anxious all the time. I want to die but I’m not actively trying to kill myself. One of the reasons why I haven’t killed myself yet is because I am scared that it will influence some of my clients to follow in my footsteps. But aside from that, I don’t have much interest in staying alive.

Am I a hypocrite for wanting to help others but not being able to help myself?"
875,"I want to die and I fantasize about killing myself everyday. The only reason I wont do it is because I do not want to hurt anyone. I am just here, rotting away."
876,"I've been on medical leave from work to seek treatment. Few know where I am. Those who know have been telling those who ask some variation of ""She's fine, just taking care of what she needs to."" Three people know...all three have told that they've just been relaying that I'm fine.


The other day, my supervisor and I talked about sending the office an email about how I'm okay and fine (her exact words) with my expected return date


Fine. My apt. is a dumpster. I don't have real relationships. All I do is eat and throw up at 31. Never once have I uttered those words ""fine"", but others are saying it for me. I don't even know what I'm hoping for or want...but I feel like my illness is all made up in my head. If I had cancer, nobody would say I was fine. I get that they are protecting my privacy but at the same time it feels like it is ""less"" than a physical illness.  


I'm feel so suicidal lately but too numb to do anything about it. I'm unbearably lonely, sad and hopeless. I'm not fine. I don't want to go back to work with a fake smile plastered on, but I have to. Because depression isn't seen as a real sickness or as serious until suicide. 


Back when I asked for leave, my supervisor even told me to let people know it wasnt something ""serious"" so that people wouldn't worry."
877,you guys are so kind and supportive of a complete stranger. I felt a strange comfort seeing your kind messages when I asked this subreddit to help me kill myself with painless suicide methods. Thank you. I havent felt that warm comforting feeling in a while. I cried.
878,"I go to one of the largest universities in the nation and am having a really tough time here while trying to not let depression take over my life. Yesterday, I was killing time in between classes as usual, sitting near some trees in a popular part of campus to study at. On a scale from 0-10, my depression was at an 8 or 9 and I desperately needed help. I posted on Yik Yak asking if anyone near me wanted to give me a hug (Yik Yak is a popular app among college students kind of like an anonymous twitter, and you can only see posts within a mile away from you or something like that). I ended up deleting the post almost instantly because I felt silly asking for a stranger to give me a hug. But within a minute, a random girl peeked at my phone, asked if I was the one who posted the anonymous cry for help and hugged me while I choked back tears. I still can't believe it happened. I didn't catch her name or say much to her but it really helped me get through the day. "
879,They're the only ones who would lose the will to live if I died. 
880,anybody in the same boat?:(
881,"The people I work with are quite bubbly, talkative, and sociable, but there are a lot of times I just don't have it in me to try to socialize. My job locks me in a room with 1-2 other people for 12 hours+, so talking and playing games is the only way to pass the time. When I'm not actively talking or contributing to the conversation and they ask me what's wrong, my response is always ""sorry, I'm just tired,"" when I mean ""sorry, I feel like a useless piece of shit today, you'll have to excuse me."" Do I want to socialize with my co-workers? Of course. Does my mood/brain want me to socialize? Hell no, it wants me to brood in the corner and overthink. 

I even do this in my personal relationships. When I'm in a bad mood (which is about 99% of the time anymore) and I shuffle around the house not really talking to anyone, and my mom or step-dad ask if I'm okay, my response is always ""I'm just tired,"" then I'll go to my room, shut my door, and only come out for basic necessities for the rest of the day. I haven't talked to my friends in God knows how long because I'm just not mentally prepared to most days. I'm scared I'll lose them eventually. My phone is never moved from where its set down when I came home from work because no one is concerned enough to talk to me unless they need something. "
882,"I spend probably 90% of my days daydreaming. Sitting in class, watching TV, playing video games etc I'm always daydreaming

I go to this fantasy world where I actually have a passion and I actually have support and friends where I'm the best at something. Some cultural icon.

It's unhealthy and it's caused me to stop myself from ever being happy in life. How could I ever be happy when all I think about is what if I was someone else? Some amazing artist? Musician? And not just this talentless loser who will spend the majority of his life grinding a 9-5 and the most exciting thing I do is play video games on the weekends?

And then I get the whole bullshit about ""well instead of daydreaming about it, go start finding your passion and get good at it""

I'm hoping you guys know that that is just bullshit. It hurts me every time. I'm tired of hearing it.

Learning how to accept being a nobody sucks. Idk if I will ever fully accept it."
883,"Sometimes I think about my current situation I'm in and I think: "" I have no reason to be depressed"" and sometimes I see others with depression who have a good reason to be depressed but sometimes I feel ashamed to think I have depression when I think of other people's misfortune despite my own misfortune.

I even avoid saying I'm depressed and just say I'm sad now because I feel like I'm insulting those who are depressed."
884,There's just nothing interesting.
885,"When I was 16 it was so strange to me. I have a journal entry where I wrote, ""This isn't who I'm supposed to be."" Everybody noticed me go from goofy A-student to constantly skipping classes and looking so empty and sad.

I tried to fight it. I really did. But fast-forward 11 years and the 16-year-old me is gone. The intelligence is there, just not applied towards anything useful or productive. The humor is there sometimes, just more morbid and mostly kept to myself. 

I am constantly fatigued, unfocused, sad, irritable, pessimistic, and anxious. The most common coping mechanisms I have that give me comfort are food and TV/games. ""Oh but I'm NOT really like this—it's my depression!"" That's what I said for a fucking decade and I can't even believe it anymore.

My depression is who I am now most of the time, and it's been that way for years. It's become my personality. It's become so normal I don't remember that people aren't supposed to feel and act like this. It's not fucking normal to take a few hours to get out of bed, not shower for days, and do nothing but binge eat, watch TV, play games, and sleep for days and even weeks on end. I can't stand it anymore.

I just took a Wellbutrin again after giving up on it after a week last time. Fuck it, can't get any worse. I have to tell myself that I have a serious problem and the only way is to get help. Because if I don't then I'm back in that damn pit again, feeling miserable yet powerless to ever change it. 

"
886,"I woke up with 30 Reddit notifications, thank you all for making me feel valued."
887,
888,"I just feel guilty about being sad all the time. Like I have a decent life, no financial trouble, or family deaths, so I feel like I don’t deserve to be depressed. I always think about how much worse other people have it in life, and it makes me think I’m just spoiled and unappreciative."
889,:(
890,"Reddit,

A year and a half ago I was bullied at work and forced to quit. I've worked side jobs ever since and have been too afraid to apply for jobs in my field (medical assisting and gi technical specialist). I have nightmares still about my past work place. I truly am still afraid of working side by side with someone again and having them spread lies about me. 

My depression has been it's worst this year after my doctor had me lower my anti depression drug dosage because I was feeling better after a year taking my increased dosage. I soon spiraled into a mess. I financially have been struggling and that has constantly been a worry for me. Many days I stay in bed and do not shower, brush my teeth or eat. I currently cannot sleep at night without the aid of sleeping pills. I do take them now though, that's something I usually haven't done.

But a couple months ago I updated my resume, applied to jobs, went on interviews..and was hired (part time) by a local hospital with my start date being tomorrow. 

From that interview to now, yeah, I've still had a rough time. I haven't paid this month's rent and can't afford to. But I finally showered. I brushed my teeth this morning. I'll brush my teeth tomorrow morning and actually go to work. 

I'M GOING TO WORK. My new manager seems like a great person. I'm still filled with anxiety but this is an entirely new hospital system, all new (to me)people and this gets my foot in the door for a full time position when/if one opens. Plus I'll be soon helping patients again and using my seven years of experience of advanced GI procedures.

All of my previous posts here have been eaten by the auto mod I think, but thank you to anyone who reads my story.

Edit: Wow, thank you so much for everyone's support. 

Here's a little something about my first day:

These new co-workers, I already can tell they talk bad about others but basically to warn me about a chatty Cathy, and from two individually they mentioned that the IT guys walking around (doing yearly maintenance it looked like) were nerds through and through...but I can't help but chuckle at that. The guys looked like they were from the 80s with what they wore and their glasses and hair. I didn't participate in that conversation but I suppose I am now. 

I assisted during one procedure today. And it went well. My preceptor has twenty years of experience in GI and I can tell she's not aware of some best practices, but she's a wonderful lady with 4 grandkids and high energy. I can appreciate that she knows what she's doing. And has the answers to my simple questions. I'll actually be working at 3 different locations for this hospital system, but I'll get comfortable with hospital #1 before I move to #2 then #3.

I also was given a few checklists to complete. One was computer education, which I completed entirely. Long story short, I had a great first day!!"
891,I talked to a girl and actually got her number. As someone with sever anxiety and depression I finally did it. She even called me cute and complimented me on my hair. For the first time in a long time I feel something.
892,"Nothing else. I'm a fucking side character in everyone's life, including my own. My personality is so fucking boring, I tried to make myself more interesting through art and fashion but turns out I'm still the same sad piece of shit. I understand why I'm not super important to anyone, I would fucking hate me too if I met me. It's my own fault and i know it but I have no idea of how to change it, it just feels like my purpose is so observe everyone else and stay quiet. I have no idea where I'm going with my life, and I don't think it's gonna go anywhere if I'm being honest. Sorry if you read all of this bullshit, end of rant"
893,"I want to be asleep so I don't have to feel the crushing emptiness, to escape the painful loneliness and to have some relief from feeling lost. I'll snuggle up with my teddy bears as best as I can and try and sleep.... though what's the point if it makes tomorrow arrive sooner? Tomorrow... another day of feeling like this. Another day of feeling like this. Then another and another.

EDIT: thank you so much for all your responses and insight, I appreciate it."
894,that includes random online people.  not fishing for attention. 
895,"I never go anywhere, always look the same, don’t do anything interesting or have any goals. It’s been this way for as long as I can remember and I know it won’t change. "
896,"he's 5 years older than me, i remember it was like summer of 2013 and i just started dodging social events, i remember one day binging season 6 of how i met your mother while all of my friends(back when i had any) were outside playing football and messing around the entire day,

i heard rumors that my neighbor failed to join the army at 20 and how he got depressed, he shut himself completely, played world of warcraft for 3 years straight, got fat, worked a job he hated, spent most of his free time drinking and doing nothing, didn't leave hometown in over 4 years, 

he overheard how i'm being anti social, depressed, indecisive and shit, we had couple of ""talks"" on his porch, he tried to put some reason into me but i was just a dumb 18 year old, one of the last times we spoke he told me something like this: 

*you can't possibly understand now, but you will see it in couple of years if you become like me, how stupid you'll feel waking up one day to realize how everyone around you has left, moved on and you are still in the same spot you were years ago... if you sit in your room and jerk off on computer all day long nothing will happen to you, ever, but it takes you years to truly realize that*

i always found it funny how he's giving me advices and shit but he is fucked up himself, it's ironic how i'm exactly like him right now, soon to be 23, unemployed for 8 months, exhausted from social anxiety and depression, i spend most of the time inside on pc, watching my friends on social media being happy and having such normal lives, big majority of ppl i know has left for jobs or college"
897,"I don't know about you guys, but I constantly feel like I'm just a lazy piece of shit, and not somebody with depression.

Doesn't matter how many suicidal thoughts I have... Nah, just a lazy shitbag who doesn't give a fuck about their degree and spends hours a day on League of Legends. 

That's me. It's great. Especially when it's backed up by your parents complaining that you don't actually study. "
898,"And start over, fresh? I feel like I have the bigger desire to change my number, move to another side of the world and just live my life there.  I feel like I’m so done with my life and where it is. "
899,
900,"As the title shows I know this won't be important to others but my BF has been suffering from severe depression after dealing with a loss and he is in the car detailing business. He has let his car go to where there was dirt and trash and piles upon piles of ""things"" in his back seats. I have only ever mentioned the state of his car once to him but I knew ultimately it would be up to him to clean it (I know I could have but when it comes to him and his car, he is the only one to do stuff to it. He just lets me drive it when I want). Well today is the DAY and even though it's something small he has been making all these steps to better himself and I support him every day as much I possibly can. I just had to tell someone :)

&#x200B;

Edit/Update: I just want to thank everyone who commented I honestly thought that only like 8 people might even like this or upvote it. I want to let you all know he had a good day and that we are doing great. I personally have suffered from depression (diagnosed at 13) for a large portion of my life and I honestly think thats what has been so great that when he has bad days/weeks and shows all the symptoms I have learned when he needs me to just be beside him and when to give him space and remind him of my constant support and love. It's not easy but it has been the easiest thing for me to love him the way I do. I hope you all find the joy in the little things and wish you all the best!"
901,"Does anyone ever have that feeling of ""I want to go home"" but home isn't your old house or your family or a time in your life before . It's a feeling that you miss but you don't actually have anymore. "
902,Guys I know this might be stupid.  But I finally was able to make my bed. Like I mean having sheets on it and stuff. I know otherwise it's gross. This is really big for me. I final didn't feel like it was useless to do. Sorry. I'm gross. But I'm actually proud. (Wish it didn't happen at 3:30 am because I can't sleep but oh well I got a burst of energy so I did it.) I'm feeling tired now but I hope this boost will stay tomorrow to clean other things.  Sorry if this sounds stupid.
903,I want to die.
904,"* You sleep 4 hours some nights and 16 hours others. 
* The grocery store is right across the street but you just can't get over there to buy food. 
* You need a dedicated blanket for your couch for those times when you just can't get up. 
* You run out of clothes to wear because you just can't make yourself do the laundry. 
* Dirty dishes pile up in the sink even when you do manage to run the dishwasher, because ypu can't manage to unload it. 
* You come home from work and just lay down on the couch because you have no energy to do anything. 
* If you're unemployed like me, same, but as soon as you wake up. 
* Sometimes you do make it out of bed, and onto the floor. The door is just too far away.

* You regularly go days without leaving your apartment.

* You take antidepressants and see a therapist and it doesn't really help. "
905,I don't know why I do this. I don't like appearing vulnerable I guess? Or maybe because my mind's so messed up they wouldn't be able to help me anyway and it's daunting to explain everything.
906,
907,"I’ve been dealing with depression for almost 8 years now. I’ve had good times, sometimes they’ll last as long as a year, but it always comes back.

I’ve reached a point where I know I’m too much of a coward to just kill myself. And I feel like if I did people would just say even more terrible things about me when I can’t defend myself...

So I call myself “casually suicidal”... I can’t bring myself to actually slide that razor... but if I just so happen to die in a freak accident... if I “forget” to look both ways... if I happen to end up in a dangerous situation... oh well... just does the work for me.

I fall asleep at night just thinking “I want to die I hope I die” in the hopes that if I think t hard enough maybe my heart will just stop while I’m sleeping and no one will be the wiser.

Does anyone else feel like this?"
908,"It has stolen our lives. 


All of the experiences you are meant to have - an innocent teenage relationship, making friends in college/highschool, marriage, having children, having fun in your early years. Most of us here have been robbed of some of these things and we will never have the chance to experience it again.


People are having fun my age, partying, socialising, having fun without overthinking it. Whereas I am stuck in my room, starving myself because I am too tired and too anxious to leave my room. People are working hard to get an incredible degree and have a great uni experience whereas I am stuck staring at the wall, too tired and unmotivated to do anything, becoming a husk of my former self.

It really hit me today. These moments have been stolen from us forever, swallowed by the gaping pit of depression. And no one will care."
909,"I don't just mean because I haven't slept, although sometimes that is the case. 

What I really mean is I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of feeling worthless and useless. I'm tired of trying so fucking hard and it still not being enough. I'm tired of getting up again. I'm tired of lying. I'm tired of people taking advantage. I'm tired of people not understanding. I'm tired of the pain. I'm tired of surviving. I'm tired of existing. I'm so goddamn tired"
910,"I'm posting this here because I don't really know where else to put it. I noticed the sidebar link to SuicideWatch, but it didn't feel right to start a thread there among all the other people who really need help. 

Since I was a teenager I've had ""casual"" suicidal thoughts. I don't mean to trivialize suicidal thoughts when I say that, I literally mean casual; like, maybe you're driving home, everything is pretty much fine, then out of nowhere you go ""I made a small mistake at work today, I should just drive into that concrete barrier"" Or I'll be hanging out at home, maybe watching TV or something, and think ""you know, you wouldn't have to deal with anything anymore if you just shot yourself in the head."" I don't think there's ever really intent, the thoughts just come. And what's kind of disturbing is that the thoughts are almost comforting for a second, kind of like ""yeah, I guess that /is/ an option!""

This has been normal for me for so long, every day for years, but recently I've been thinking about how fucked up it is. And I feel alone because it's like you can't tell anybody about it or else they'll immediately go into call-the-cops freakout mode. 

I just had to get this off my chest. It's difficult to have these cavalier thoughts and feel like a freak on top of keeping a lid on the depression/anxiety/""imposter syndrome"" to seem normal every day. "
911,"I can't imagine anyone even thinking of me, even for a brief second, when I'm not in the room. All my life I've been forgotten and invisible. No wonder I'm so depressed."
912,
913,"For no particular reason. 

Just as a baby step, going outside, enjoying myself **for myself**. I've forgotten how to do this. Let's re-try for hundredth time."
914,"Ok, done. They said the same old platitudes that everyone has heard a million times. ""It gets better"" ""take it day by day"" ""lots of people care about you"" etc. 

So now that they know an embarrassing and vulnerable fact about me, what have I gained? Do I feel better? Are they going to have any insight or advice that I haven't already learned? Ha, no. At best they have sympathy for me (which I don't want), and at worst they will be uncomfortable and not want to interact with me anymore (this happened with 3 different friends before I finally learned my lesson).

I mean, perhaps that helps for people with very mild or temporary depression. And that's fine and all, but it's pretty discouraging when the advice literally begins and ends with ""talk to someone."" If you say ""yeah so I tried that..."" they'll just throw their hands up and tell you to use drugs. 

Or just say ""hang in there!"" Hang in there, huh? Just a few more decades and you'll die naturally :) Hang in there, every day is a living hell with no respite from the emotional numbness/pain, but do it anyway :) Depression causes you to be a worthless failure because you don't have the motivation to further your career or social life, but hang in there as a complete loser!

Then of course the natural progression beyond 'someone' is a 'therapist.' ""Talk to a therapist and get help."" Ok, let me just pull money out of my ass, and pay hundreds of dollars for someone who probably won't be able to do shit for me anyway. But that's another story..."
915,For me I had a pretty traumatic childhood. I don’t remember most of it except for some of the really bad things. It feels like my brain just blocked everything to protect me or something.
916,"So I procrastinate far *far* too much. Absolutely nothing motivates me to do work any more. Nothing at all. Back in high school I was a pretty good student. I got all my work done on time, literally never missed an assignment etc. But in college, I just can't bring myself to do anything. 

I have a huge project that needs to be completed and the idea was that we'd do a few weeks of work in class and the rest at home. Ever since the class sessions ended, I haven't even looked at it. And it was due to be finished 2 weeks ago. I open the file, look at it for a couple of minutes and then put it away. In part, it is because I find it incredibly difficult (and yes, I have asked for help but none of it made it any easier for me) but it's also because I've pretty much just fallen into a pit of inescapable procrastination. I wake up way too late, stay in bed for at least an hour after waking up, sit around playing video games, glance at my work, play more video games and then go back to bed. For god's sake, I even put off making this post for a week.

Is anyone else like this? It's slowly destroying my grades right now and the longer it goes on, the harder it's going to be to get out of this complete mess that my life is at the moment."
917,I have had anxiety and depression for a really long time and recently I've been thinking that I might have lost at least some of my mental capacity and I was just wondering if anyone felt the same or had anything to contribute to the thought.
918,"She texted me to say good bye while I was gone for a couple hours today. I was busy and didn't even see the message for 30 minutes. She was gone by the time I got back home. She had been fighting depression and I guess she lost. I called friends and family for support right after 911. They've been with me all day, but now that everyone is sleeping, I can't. The image of her hanging there will haunt me until my dying days. That was my baby, my better half. Falling asleep without her at my side just feels wrong. There's a huge hole in me and I don't know what to do or how to handle it. I just cry, I've been crying since 3pm. My face hurts, hell, my whole body hurts. To anyone that has lost their love, how did you handle it? What gave you the will to want to go another day? Or anyone that just wants to talk, keep my mind off that image. Not suicidal though, couldn't imagine putting someone through what I'm feeling.

Thanks for the kind wishes everyone. The xanax has finally kicked, in chest isnt hurting so much and I'm cross-eyed.hopefully be able to get some sleep. Can't take any more tonight.

I was able to get a few hours of sleep this morning from the xanax. Spent today with friends keeping me busy, I haven't cared about any of it. I've been out of it, just following them around, nothing matters to me anymore. I know the sun shown today, but I didnt notice it. I've caught myself pulling out in traffic without looking, not on purpose now but it has happened a couple of times. Not sure why, I guess it just doesn't matter to me anymore. I'm gonna quit driving for now. My school friend said our college has grief counseling. I will be going there in the morning. I knoweveryone is trying their best to help me, but I'm just cold. Cold and hurting and it seems to be getting worse. Tonight will be rough again. 

Everyone is sleeping again and I've taken my xanax so I apologize for spelling errors and  whatnot. Just wanted to give some back story. Beyond an abusive family she had, gang raped, losing her son 3 years ago today, losing her mother to suicide 2 years ago today. She was the most compassionate person to me. She had tried this before before we met. We didn't find, never did. Once when I did get upset with her, I caught her heating up a lighter tip and buring.her self eith. I'll finish this in the morminf

It's night time again, this is starting to feel like a journal. I want to thank everyone for their kind words and support, being able to read your encouragements and relatable stories  throughout my day has helped, more than I can express in text. Today has been one fucking hard day to put it lightly. I got some answers to my questions on why what happened did happen and that only raised more questions. I'll give an censored cliff note version to keep from airing her dirty laundry in the public, but I think its important for me to write this down. And I apologize from typing errors too, been doing this on my phone as my computer is still in the apartment. My gf wasn't from here, I never met or talked to any of her family. I didn't even know their names. She told me that there was a really bad childhood for her and that she had lost 2 children  with her husband years back. So I never asked questions, I just listened when she felt like she needed to talk about it. Eventually, she finally told me there was a younger 3rd child that was still alive with the now ex husband. She said they divorced when the children died, on Oct 15. Fast forward a year, her mother took her own life on Oct 15 for the guilt of feeling responsible. That was 2 years ago.we started dating in no November of last year. She started seeing a therapist for the past 3 months this year that was a very nice lady that she trusted. Well then her incident occurs from the guilt and grief, she blamed her self for those deaths which was completely unwarranted. The coroner had no idea of how to get in touch with family, so that's been my goal since then. I got in touch with the ex husband and an old close friend of hers from back then. I wasn't prepared for theinfo they had about her. The reason shed been crying and putting herself through hell, didn't exist. Well her mom was gone but not for what I was told. There was only two sons and they were both alive, she basically drove off one day and never came back. That was a few months before we met. She liveds those lies for the year everyone kew her here. I talked to her therapist and she was just blown away. All we can figure was that she was so much more mentally dustrurbed than any of us had any idea. Therapist figures she was delusional, maybe borderline schizo. There was really nothing we could've done to help her given the info we didn't know, it was like throwing a bucket of water on a house fire. Id here her talking to herself, but now I'm not sure that she wasn't just having conversations with someone she thought that was there. She would tell me about her conversations shed been having with her old friends that she was able to get in touch with, that really haven't heard from her in over a year. It's just so much to process. Shed actually be excited that she got to talk to them. She believed her delusion so strongly, no one had a reason to doubt it. This just makes things clearer and so much more sad.

12/03/2012: I am doing much better everyone. I thank you all for you thoughts and concerns. Life has gotten easier as time is passing on for the most part. The only lingering effects is the last image of her, every time something remind me of her my mind goes straight to that. That happens quite a bit, but hopefully that will pass as the other pain has. To those that have messaged me saying how much this has helped them, it really means a lot to me. I am glad some good could have come from this at least. If anyone needs to talk, please feel free to message me."
919,It happens to me when I watch TV or listen to music. 
920,"About a week ago my wife left the apartment, bought a gun, drove somewhere secluded, pulled over and shot herself. I have been with her since 2007 when we were still in high school. We became adults together.

I have always had mildish depression and anxiety, but she has always had major depression and suicidal ideation. It just kept getting worse and worse. She tried all sorts of medications, therapy (including DBT). She had a partial diagnosis for BPD as well.

I'm not even exactly sure why I am posting here other than to vent a bit. I see a regular therapist and have an appointment monday. I am also on an SSRI already, so I am taking the proper steps. I just am so beside myself. I always knew it would happen. She told me it would and that there was no way to change it. I lived in constant fear and anxiety that she would have a breakdown or even kill herself. I had to make so many excuses for her to my family throughout the years. I could always tell they disproved (even if only a little bit) of me putting so much effort into her. I think they better understand now.

I do not mean to be dramatic, but I feel like, even though I do not regret being with her, it has tormented me in a deep, possibility irreversible way. I know she never meant to harm me and it was the depressed train of thinking she had, but only about a week before she killed herself, I finally got her to admit what I suspected for a long time. She was distancing herself from me for 8 months in order to soften the blow of her suicide. For 8 months at least, she was purposefully distant, did not even try to console me when the situation became too hard for me. I felt so alone. I hate myself for being just a bit relieved that she is dead, because the pain of seeing her suffer was so unimaginably hard to bear.

I feel so angry at her parents, especially her mom, for always putting her down. Making her feel worthless. Her mother is the literal worst person I know. She always acted as if she supported her daughter in everything she did when out in public, but in private she shit on everything she did. My wife was literally a genius at least according to the IQ tests the doctors gave her when diagnosing her mental illnesses. She was an incredible artist who painted, drew, sewed, wood burned, and a shit ton of other things. Anything art, she could do. And her parents hated that, because she did not want to join the Navy like them or go into business. She wanted to teach and almost achieved her dreams before the depression worsened to the point that she quit school and work.

I just wish could have been different for her. All she ever wanted to do was help people and make the world better. I just want to sit on my ass and play video games. Why here and not me. I work in corrections and see a bunch of scum everyday who love the fuck out of themselves. Why not them. She never hurt a god damn soul.

Edit: A name.

Edit 2: I just want everyone to know that I was hesitant about even posting anything about my situation, but I am glad that I did because it has been very therapeutic. I only have two people in my life that really understand depression and how it affect one's thoughts, feeling and beliefs. Most of the people in my life just do not have the ability to comprehend what happened and I am both glad and deeply saddened that the people here do. So thank you everyone.

Edit 3: Thank you kind stranger for the gold. I think I know who is was, but I will just leave it at that.

Edit 4: Just a few photos of my wife's art.

921,"If that makes sense? Even when I'm not feeling so down I still don't do anything like go out and see friends. It's almost as if being depressed has become an ingrained habit and I don't know how to break out of it. 

If I was magically cured of depression I'm not sure that anything would actually change because I'm so used to seeing no one and doing nothing. 

Does anyone else feel like that? "
922,"A while ago I told my psychiatrist that I want to be dead and that I’ve been having suicidal thoughts for a while and I’ll never get his reaction out of my head. He told me “why kill yourself now when you can still do it later”

Idk, it was the first time someone didn’t react badly when I told them about my thoughts and I can’t even disagree with him lmao"
923,"I hate being a girl with excessive body hair I just want to be normal. I fucking hate my life and I hate the way I look. Fuck this.  No guy will ever like me or want to be with me. I’ll be alone. I don’t have hope for anything.




EDIT: Thank you all for the kind words and messages. I appreciate it so much. I feel really lonely a lot of the time but this really helped. I’m still struggling to get past the excessive body hair but at least I’m trying. Again, thank you ❤️"

I've been embarrassed driving the car as is, but can't care enough to just do it. I don't care about work, eating, exercising, watching a movie, doing something online, etc. I just don't care.

928,"Hi there, I'm a 23 year old male who turns 24 in August. I have been struggling with depression for a few years now, and it's all coming to a sort of unbearable boiling point. I have completely, entirely wasted the 18-23 phase of my life, and I'm completely devastated about it.

If you'll excuse this, I'm going to allow myself to be dramatic and expressive in this post. I just need to get this out, throw it out in the world and see if anyone can help me. 

Honestly, I can say I've struggled with this all my life, but it's been more severe since 18. All I did in my younger years was play video games. I didn't learn a skill that would blossom into a career, I didn't grow into a man. I stayed a child, and I am a child now. In high school, all I did was waste my potential and genuine ability so I could play games and not have to think about responsibility. My senior year I didn't even apply for a college. I graduated and went to a community college even though I didn't know why I was there. 

From that point, all I did was aimlessly fail school for 3 years (18-21), meet a toxic girl (first love) that broke my heart after a 6 month relationship (21-almost 22), and instead of being a strong person and pushing through the heartbreak, I then let that heartbreak tumble into a toxic rut of depression that lasted for a year, where I left school and did absolutely nothing but work an unsustainable job (delivery driver with my own car that is now almost used up), lay around, and put on 50 pounds. Once that depressive period related to my ex was over, I realized with shock that I had done absolutely nothing during that time and failed an opportunity to gain inner strength. So what did I do? Did I snap out of it and start climbing upward? No. I was so horrified, and I slid into an even darker, existential depression that has lasted up to current day and is reaching a boiling point. 

The ""good"" news is that after three semesters of just laying around (not even using the time off to do something adventurous or awesome), I started back into school this spring, and though my GPA is shit from my earlier failings, I will almost surely finish with A's in both my two classes this semester. I still have no idea what I want to do long-term, but I'm ok with that. 

What I'm realizing now is sort of an exponentially increased version of what I realized after my first rut. I now realize that not only have I done nothing with my recent time, but I've done nothing during the entire 18-23 period of my life but wallow, and I will never be able to do it over. I'm almost 24, and I'm starting to feel my perception of time speed up. This is quite honestly making me panic severely. I feel like I'm going to blink and be 40, then blink again and be 70. I don't really know what to say. I feel so up against it. I could have spent the last 5 years actually finding myself, or traveling, backpacking, adventuring. At the very least I could have been responsible and had my B.S by now, and NOW I could be adventurous for a period before getting a job or going to grad school.

But now I won't finish my degree until I'm 26 or 27, and I could be 33 before I'm done if I want to pursue further education. I see people who are 18, 19, 20 and going on adventures, taking advantage of that time. People I know. And it makes me sob inside. 

I feel that there is some neoteny going on here. The thought of the magic of childhood ending has always been too much for me to think about. I feel that these years are a result of this. I was terrified to grow up. Now I'm at the age where I'm on the roller coaster of adult time with or without my permission, and I wasted those precious, fun transition years.

I wish I had done SOMETHING responsible in the past 6 years. I wish  I had worked hard, maybe learned a trade in my teens so I could have moved out, felt secure, and pursued a fulfilling career with my feet under me. I can't bear the weight of the situation I've put myself into. I can't even think about it straight enough to organize this post. The only responsible thing I've done is pay off 2k in debt last year. That's it.

My parents look at me with this look in their eyes. Like they're thinking, ""what is he doing with his life?"", that they can sense the personal Hell I've boxed myself up in. The reality of this is so damn final. 

Every time I watch a movie, I have this sort of sorrowful pang in my heart as I watch the heroism of the characters. Spiderman made me long to be 18 and start my youthful adult adventure, but do it right this time. Even about my childhood, I feel the same way. If I see a character in a movie being taught by his father to be a self-sufficient man, it makes me desperately wish I had spent my youth building skills, or learning self-sufficiency instead of gaming and ... gaming.

I just don't know what to do. My heart BEGS to have another chance, and I of course know that's an impossibility, so I feel paralyzed by finality. 

This part about my time perception speeding me up is what really  started this boiling point. I'm cracking under the weight of it. I want to grow into being a man, learn skills, become secure and self-sufficient, go on adventures, have a period of joyful expression and free adventure before I have to walk into the monotony of adulthood. But now, even if I do these things, I'll push my degree off even further, or my bank account even lower, and I'll be in my 30's before I even get to where most people are at my current age. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know what I should do. I don't even really know what I want to do. I don't want to be 24. I don't want to have this weight on me. I want to take this darkness and use it to make me stronger, wiser, more experienced, self-sufficient, mature in the truest sense of the word. I want to experience a full 50-60-70 more years, not a cheapened, sped up version that only feels 20 youthful years. I just want to conquer this, and finally experience fulfillment, adventure and joy."

931,"Out of the very few times i have the energy to speak and suggest positive happy things, shut down. I feel my body's emotion literally shift. i get lethargic, my smile immediately fades and i don't speak the rest of the day. The out of my stomach drops and my chest begins to form that empty feeling.

It sucks. I hate this feeling, what's the point in being positive or telling me to be if you're the one that won't even acknowledge me while im speaking as well or reply rude or curt or short when I thought we were having a good time and im just talking about stuff i like or want to do.

It hurts."
932,"I force myself to replace it with ""I want to try"". I don't know if it's working, but I'm still here."
933,"I have lost the drive to get through life and care about what happens to me and that makes me depressed.  I have been medicated and see a therapist but nothing is working. I also have friends and family that care deeply for me.  But that almost makes it worse, they're caring for someone whose ability to care about anything is broken. Its as if I am a black hole and their caring is matter that just disappears when it reaches me.
 There isn't really anything I enjoy and just existing is overwhelming.  And I am no longer young anymore (I am 34) so it feels like time is running out.  What is the point of living if I see no point in it?  I am alive because killing myself would devistate my mom and others that care about me, but is that really worth it? Existing just to please others while feeling no pleasure and mostly pain?  "
934,"The idea of never having to worry again/being free from any expectations is really appealing, but I don’t think the positives of suicide will ever outweigh the negatives for me. But I imagine killing myself A LOT. Anyone else feel this way?"
935,"Anyone else feel like it's not even the anxiety, isolation, lack of interest etc. that feels the worst, it's the sense that nothing sufficiently bad has happened to you to make you feel like you *earned* being depressed? I remember at one of my lowest points a few years ago not wanting to call the hotline because I thought they would tell me it was reserved for people with *real* problems, of which I had none. I just feel absolutely awful wasting away all of the time, energy, and money my family poured into me over the years when I feel depressed when I can't point to anything specific that's causing it. Makes me feel weak, like I should just be able to snap out of it, and when I don't, the guilt multiplies how bad I feel."
936,"Hey, friends! Today I want to talk about suicidal depression. Every time there's a big suicide in the news, I see a lot of conversation that makes me concerned. It seems like depression is a problem that lots of people don't understand very well. I'm sorry this is so long, but it's an issue that's very close to me. 

I see people say things like ""It was the coward's way out"" or ""he threw it all away over nothing."" You should understand that depression is extremely real to people who are struggling with it. It's an illness. Your brain isn't working properly, the same way a broken limb doesn't work properly. Instead of being unable to walk, you're unable to process positive feelings. You're constantly in a state of sadness, or anger, or fear, or self-loathing. This is a lifelong condition for many people. You can develop coping strategies, but there's no real ""cure"" or universal answer. If that imagery is not helpful, it's like having goblins in your brain. It's like fighting an enemy every single day that you can't see who makes it impossible for you to be happy. It doesn't matter that you have all these nice things and people who love you, because you physically can't enjoy them or anything else. That's a really hard way to live. It hurts me when I hear people with depression described as ""weak."" They have to be strong and brave everyday, just to leave their house or have social interactions. These are people fighting a war that makes it difficult or painful to do very basic things. It is tragic when someone dies fighting that battle, but it is not shameful. 

The second thing I want to talk about is dismissive solutions. I LOVE that treatment for mental illness is becoming more socially acceptable. However, it seems like some people think the conversation ends at ""Get help."" ""If only he had gotten help!"" ""Why didn't he get help?"" ""Why didn't he dial H-E-L-P on the phone so the Helpers in the Help Van could take him to the Helpatorium?"" It is absolutely important to tell people ""get help."" It is sometimes a little patronizing when it's coming from people who don't understand how hard that is. I've seen this taken to a very nasty place, where people say things like ""it's his fault for not getting help. Why should I have sympathy?"" If you're struggling with depression, I want to stress that seeking help absolutely should be the most important thing in your life after basic survival necessities. If you've never struggled with depression, I want to stress that seeking help can be MUCH harder than you think it is. 

I have struggled with suicidal depression for most of my adult life. I called the suicide hotline back when I was delivering pizzas. It is not a magical fix-everything service. They told me their nearest facility was further away than I could afford to drive on my gas budget. I've tried talking about depression to most of my friends. I'm fortunate to have some great people in my life, but I've lost a lot of relationships because I was open about depression. There are people who don't understand, and they get angry at you when their misguided attempts to help don't work. There are people who just slowly back out of your life because talking to you makes them sad or uncomfortable. I don't blame these people. It is very difficult to deal with someone else's depression. That's nobody's fault, but it makes depression very isolating. I've tried to get professional help many times. I've had doctors who were helpful, but we couldn't afford them. I've had doctors who were unhelpful and made things worse. I've been put on medications that made me better for a little while. I've been put on medications that messed me up so badly I couldn't leave my house and had to switch high schools. This is not even getting into how hard it can be emotionally to seek treatment. You have to be able to admit your deepest problems to yourself, and talk about them articulately with total strangers. I don't know a lot of people who can do that, even without depression. It is very difficult to seek any sort of treatment at all when you honestly don't like yourself and don't believe you deserve to get better. I'm not telling this as a sob story to try and garner sympathy. I just want people to understand that everybody struggling with depression has stories like this. We almost never talk about them because we are trying to pretend to be normal.

I hate when posts like this are all criticism, so I'll try to leave with something helpful. You have so much more power than you think you do to help another person. Even when you don't feel like you're making a difference, the smallest acts of kindness can really touch people in unexpected ways. You probably don't understand depression. That is okay! We appreciate it when you are honest about not understanding. We're sick of people telling us they understand when they don't. You don't have to understand. You just have to believe us. "
937,"That's it. This has been yet another dumpster fire of a year. Every year has been worse than the one before since 2016. This year was a banner year. One of my best friends lost her child. I lost my best friend of 20 years in the fall out. But if I'm not gonna call it quits, I'm just hurting myself. 2020 is time to heal. And that's my mantra. I hope it's yours too."
938,I just feel like I don’t deserve it.
939,"I’m 22, senior in college, and some days I’m in up to four classes. If I don’t have to work that day, work requires me to talk, I can go through the entire day with having little to no interaction with another human. No one texts me throughout the day, no one talks to me before or after classes, and I feel as though no one even looks at me when I walk down the street, Beyond the cashier at the cafe telling me my coffee and donut is $3, I feel as though I don’t exist. I’m not suicidal but that doesn’t mean the thought that if I’d I disappear the entire world would continue moving without noticing hasn’t graced my mind. 

To complicate things I’ve even walked by friends, best of friends, without them noticing me or saying hi, even if I make an attempt to. I try to just enjoy my walk but being surrounded by so many people makes me feel claustrophobic. 

Today in particular I decided to dress nicer, maybe I’d get someone to notice me. I wore something my ex-gf had always thought I looked handsome in. The painful reality is that I felt even more alone today, more distant from the entire society of college that I wanted to run as far as I could away from it.

People are always telling me that “if you want to make friends or meet a girl, you have to be the one to make that first conversation” but if that’s the case why isn’t any ever trying to make that conversation with me. 

Thank-you for noticing me today. "
940,"Everyday is so monotonous and I have trouble doing the simplest things. Everyone says it's going to get better, but I'm just getting more and more tired of all of this. "
941,"I thought this was my safe place. An accepting place.

Now I'm not sure where to go.

I feel so alone."
942,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not suicidal. I'm far too cowardly to actually kill myself. I'm just tired of existing. I just wish there was some way I could just stop existing, without actually having to kill myself. I'm sad all the time, and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of pretending to be okay, because if I don't then I get accused of attention seeking. I can't stand being alive anymore. I'm tired, mentally and physically, and I don't know how to handle it anymore.

Edit: Thank you so much to everyone who commented with advice and offers to listen. It means so much to me and, I'm sure, so many others who feel the same way. To all those who commented saying they relate and talking about feeling suicidal, I'm not a certified therapist, but I'm willing to listen if you want to talk about it. I'm just a PM away to anyone who wants to talk. I'll listen. Thank you all for making me feel less alone, and slightly more normal for a while."
943,"I pretty much don't know where to go at this point. I keep telling myself things could always be worse and then things actually get worse and so I just repeat that phrase ad infinitum. Lately it seems like the big man upstairs has it out for me.

Edit: holy butts this blew up. I'm overwhelmed with all the love people are showing. I'll try and answer all of you."
944,"no one wakes up in the morning and thinks to himself, ""i'm so excited to see her today!"" 

no one sits around and waits for me to text back 

no one's first thought when they're happy or something good happens is to text me

no one asks me to call them when i get home 

no one cares enough to tell me, ""no, not another drink""

my mom would rather spend time with my brother and my dad loves my sister more than life itself

i am no one's best friend, i am not the love of anyone's life, i'm not anyone's favorite student. i'm not anyone's person. people care about me, sure, but i'm no one's favorite. there is not a single person that values me above all the rest and that hurts. 

i'm just another friend, another face to blend into the crowd. i'm no one special or important and it makes me want to cry. i'm not my best friend's best friend. i'm not my favorite professor's favorite. i'm not my person's person and it's fucking miserable. 

edit: i am so surprised by the number of responses. i had no idea that other people felt this way and, while i think we can all agree that feeling this way sucks, i'm glad that i could be a source of resonance for some people. and hey, fuck the world, let's be each other's favorite person. "
945,"Don't you feel like wanting people to just get off your back and leave you alone, except that you don't really wanna be alone?

Don't you also feel so sad that you internalize everything but you still hope that someone... ANYONE will just read your mind and come by to give you what you want to hear, except you actually don't know what you want and you can't tell them because you already know what they'll say?

And don't you also feel so... defeated but you hope that maybe eventually you'll find a reason, maybe a person, or at least a way to cure this feeling... but not really?

Yeah sorry guys I don't really have a place to vent,  just wanted to share.

Edit: Wow I honestly never expected this to get this much attention, thank you for the support guys :,)"
946,This is hard for me to tell anyone because every time the talk about depression comes up I get told why should you be depressed. I don’t know what to do and I honestly just want to shut myself away from it all some times but there are others around me that will get affected by the way I start to act. I don’t even know if I should be posting things up as I n is the internet can be a bad place sometimes....  
947,"If you live a banal life, you work for around 8 hours everyday. If you enter the time wasted getting to work (for me anyway) it's 2 more hours. It means that approximately 41% of your day is spent wasting your life away at a dead-end job. This isn't even including sleeping. If you sleep between 6 and 8 hours, it's 25% or 33% of you day gone too, leaving you with about 26% of free time everyday. In this time you need to shower, eat and go to the toilet so it's even less than that.

&#x200B;

I don't have any friends or lover. I don't really have anything I'm really passionate about so even the tiny fraction of daily free time I have is just spent trying to escape boredom.

I won't kill myself because I don't want to bother my family members, but man, living is just a gigantic pain in the ass. I don't even think I'm depressed anymore, I just don't see a point in living, it's too much effort for me. I just want to wither away."
948,"He was so supportive. He held me, asked me if there was anything he could do to help me. He told me he would set me up with an appointment with a therapist if I wanted and told me I'm not alone. Honestly, I duct expect otherwise because my husband is a rare find, a true gift and all around wonderful human. But depression had me by the neck, scared to let him in and it's lifted a huge weight to talk about my depression with him, and to be honest the first time out loud, to anyone, ever

Edit: I just wanted to say thank you to everyone for your kind and support words, it means so much to me and it feels like there could be a light at the end of this tunnel for the first time in a long time ♥️ and gold?? Wow I'm honored honestly thank you so much!"
949,"I'm often finding myself thinking that it would be easier if I found someone as lonely as me, to the point that we would be dependant on each other and kinda resolve part of our problems

Does anybody else feel like this?"
950,"I know it sounds stupid but it made me happy. I was feeling very sad and you could probably see it on my face. The woman smiled at me and it cheered me up because I was dying inside. Sometimes the little things matter. 

Edit: I wish she knew that she saved my life today because I was close to ending it. Thank you stranger. "
951,"I really need some help.

Last year my Dad died from a spontaneous heart attack at the age of 66.  Zero warning.  One minute we're just talking about seeing a movie the next weekend, and the next morning the coroner woke me up pounding on the door saying he dropped dead in his truck two blocks from the house on the way to work.

Ironically, he was in great shape and we worked out every weekend.  He didn't smoke or drink and his doctor said he had the fitness of someone half his age.  He was the pinnacle of health at that age, and this happens somehow.

He was my only family and I'd been living with him for a few years after graduating college.  I'm one of those ""probably borderline autistic, zero social life"" kind of weirdos, who was in a position where his Dad told me I could just live with him, work my job, and spend free time working on my passion, which was writing soundtrack music.

In an instant my whole world - the only person who ever mattered - was ripped away from me.  The tiny life insurance dried up in a year after settling the estate and his debts and the funeral, and I'm sitting here in my office right now just about ready to scream uncontrollably.

There are so many bills, so so many bills, and my job can barely cover them.  My fiancee has been out of work for two years due to an injury and I'm supporting both of us, while trying to maintain the house, with no friends or other family to speak of, and it's a battle I'm slowly losing every day.

I don't have any time for myself any more.  I don't have time to exercise, don't have time to clean, don't have time to make music, don't have time to go back to school to get another degree that hopefully pays better than the first because I'm just at the end of my rope.

And above all else I miss my dad, every single day.

The one ""saving grace"" is that I also inherited his retirement account, which ironically he was never able to even touch.  And now I can't touch it until I'm 65 either, and I don't think I'll make it that far.  I honestly worry about being homeless, about having my whole life wasted because I'm so alone with this burden of a room filling with water and I can only take out one tiny bucket at a time.

And I feel locked within my own body and totally unable to do anything.  Some days I go to sleep and honestly hope I never wake up.

I hate this.  I hate everything.  I hate myself and this whole situation and all the people who were so mean to me my whole life, only to end up in a happy place with my Dad and then to have him taken away with no warning, no explanation, and no way to stop.

Every day of my life I want to cry, to breathe, to take a break from all this stress and sadness, and yet I have to get up and drag myself to this office because otherwise my fiancee and I will not be able to survive.

I need a break from all of this, but I can't, because my entire existence is tied to me working and trying to keep my head above water.

I don't know what to do.

**Edit:**  Hey everybody, I just wanted to say thank you for all your insight and thoughtful words.  I ended up going to bed yesterday after a bit of dialogue on this topic and had absolutely no idea this topic would explode the way it has.

I'm going to try to reply to as many people as possible but honestly feel a bit overwhelmed (in a positive way, of course - I've never had so many people actually caring about me).  Just please know that I've read everything you've posted and if I don't get back to you immediately, I genuinely appreciate all of your thoughts and kindness."
952,"A lot has happened in a very short amount of time. When shit hits it really hits hard.

This Christmas I got dumped by my SO of 5 years. Two months prior to the breakup he started being very mean and mentally abusive. I have abandonment issues due to childhood trauma, and he made sure to push every trigger. He was  my best friend. The only one I really trusted. And now he's gone.

After the breakup I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I'm in therapy and on meds now, which helps a bit. But it's still so bad that I had to quit my job. I just couldn't go back there. I haven't spoken to anyone, except sent a few texts, since new years. I don't go out of the house except to go to therapy. I'm too afraid. I've shut myself in and everyone else out. My friends send me texts now and then. I know they care, but I just don't have the strengt to answer them.

Yesterday I got texts telling me that a good friend, the kindest guy I ever knew, had died from suicide. I feel so guilty. How could I not have known? What is I hadn't shut him (and everyone else) out. What if I could have talked him out if it? 

With depression comes thoughts of hopelessness, despair, feelings of not being good enough, being worthless. A failure. I've felt all those things. But right now I don't just feel it. It IS me. I don't feel like a failure, I am a failure. 

There are so many 'what if's'. What if I could have saved the relationship. What if I could have saved my connection with my friends. What if I had tried harder. What if I had pushed myself and went back to work. What if I could have saved my friend.

I'm so scared of being alone, yet I can't bring myself to talk to friends. Right now I feel utterly and horribly alone.

What if. Just what if.

Edit: 
I never imagined getting this type of support. From the bottom of my heart; thank you. Thank you for the kind words, the uplifting comments, the stories of your own hardships.

I've always been introverted and never had a lot of friends. I used to play a lot of video games, but even on  online games I play alone. Depending on someone, even in a game, scares me a lot. So I've never been part of a community. But right now, I feel like I've been in the wrong all this time. I feel like I might find something here. A friend, comfort, or someone to discuss the weather with. 
When I am stronger I'd like to be a helpful part of this community. I'd like to pay you back, or at least pay it forward.

I'm doing ok. I try not to think. That's why I haven't written sooner. I couldn't bare to look at my phone. I read, watch HBO, read, HBO, read, HBO. I can't let myself think. 
When I think I see my dead friend or my ex. How I'll never be with any one of them again. I can't do that. I have to keep my mind busy."

954,"Is anybody else in a similar position? I mean, there are days when I just wake up, get food by myself, go to class, study, go to sleep, and the cycle repeats. Days when I don't even say a simple ""Hello"" to even one person. It's not a matter of ignoring people, it's just simply hard for me to connect to the world. "
